### Additional basic types and macros

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<cstddef>` | |
| size_t | unsigned integer type returned by the sizeof operator   (typedef) |
| ptrdiff_t | signed integer type returned when subtracting two pointers   (typedef) |
| nullptr_t(C++11) | the type of the null pointer literal nullptr   (typedef) |
| NULL | implementation-defined null pointer constant   (macro constant) |
| max_align_t(C++11) | trivial type with alignment requirement as great as any other scalar type   (typedef) |
| offsetof | byte offset from the beginning of a standard-layout type to specified member   (function macro) |
| byte(C++17) | the byte type   (enum) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | |
| Defined in header `<cstdbool>`(deprecated) (until C++20) | |
| Defined in header `<stdbool.h>` | |
| __bool_true_false_are_defined(C++11)(deprecated) | C compatibility macro constant, expands to integer literal 1   (macro constant) |
|  | |
| Defined in header `<cstdalign>`(deprecated) (until C++20) | |
| Defined in header `<stdalign.h>` | |
| __alignas_is_defined(C++11)(deprecated) | C compatibility macro constant, expands to integer literal 1   (macro constant) |
| __alignof_is_defined(C++11)(deprecated) | C compatibility macro constant, expands to integer literal 1   (macro constant) |

### Fixed width integer types (since C++11)

### Fixed width floating-point types (since C++23)

### Numeric limits

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<limits>` | |
| numeric_limits | provides an interface to query properties of all fundamental numeric types   (class template) |

#### C numeric limits interface

### Runtime type identification

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<typeinfo>` | |
| type_info | contains some typeâ€™s information, the class returned by the typeid operator   (class) |
| bad_typeid | exception that is thrown if an argument in a typeid expression is null   (class) |
| bad_cast | exception that is thrown by an invalid dynamic_cast expression, i.e. a cast of reference type fails   (class) |
|  | |
| Defined in header `<typeindex>` | |
| type_index(C++11) | wrapper around a `type_info` object, that can be used as index in associative and unordered associative containers   (class) |

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 4036 | C++11 | `__alignof_is_defined` was underspecified in the C++ standard | specified and deprecated |
