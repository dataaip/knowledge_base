| Defined in header `<wchar.h>` |  |  |
| wint_t putwchar( wchar_t ch ); |  | (since C95) |
|  |  |  |

Writes a wide character ch to `stdout`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ch | - | wide character to be written |

### Return value

ch on success, WEOF on failure.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <locale.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <wchar.h>
 
int main()
{
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
 
    const wchar_t data[] =
    {
        L'\u2200', // Unicode name: "FOR ALL"
        L'∀',
        L'\n',
    };
 
    for (size_t t = 0; t != (sizeof data / sizeof(wchar_t)); ++t)
    {
        if (putwchar(data[t]) == WEOF)
        {
            puts("I/O error in putwchar");
            return EXIT_FAILURE;
        }
    }
 
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

```

Possible output:

```
∀∀

```
