| void resize( size_type count ); | (1) | (constexpr since C++20) |
| void resize( size_type count, CharT ch ); | (2) | (constexpr since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Resizes the string to contain count characters.

If the current size is less than count, additional characters are appended:

1) Initializes appended characters to CharT() ('\0' if `CharT` is char).2) Initializes appended characters to ch.

If the current size is greater than count, the string is reduced to its first count elements.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| count | - | new size of the string |
| ch | - | character to initialize the new characters with |

### Exceptions

std::length_error if count > max_size() is true.
Any exceptions thrown by corresponding `Allocator`.

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
 
int main()
{
    const unsigned desired_length{8};
    std::string long_string("Where is the end?");
    std::string short_string("H");
 
    std::cout << "Basic functionality:\n"
              << "Shorten:\n"
              << "1. Before: " << std::quoted(long_string) << '\n';
    long_string.resize(desired_length);
    std::cout << "2. After:  " << std::quoted(long_string) << '\n';
 
    std::cout << "Lengthen with a given value 'a':\n"
              << "3. Before: " << std::quoted(short_string) << '\n';
    short_string.resize(desired_length, 'a');
    std::cout << "4. After:  " << std::quoted(short_string) << '\n';
 
    std::cout << "Lengthen with char() == " << static_cast<int>(char()) << '\n'
              << "5. Before: " << std::quoted(short_string) << '\n';
    short_string.resize(desired_length + 3);
    std::cout << "6. After:  \"";
    for (char c : short_string)
        std::cout << (c == char() ? '@' : c);
    std::cout << "\"\n\n";
 
    std::cout << "Errors:\n";
    std::string s;
 
    try
    {
        // size is OK, no length_error
        // (may throw bad_alloc)
        s.resize(s.max_size() - 1, 'x');
    }
    catch (const std::bad_alloc& ex)
    {
        std::cout << "1. Exception: " << ex.what() << '\n';
    }
 
    try
    {
        // size is OK, no length_error
        // (may throw bad_alloc)
        s.resize(s.max_size(), 'x');
    }
    catch (const std::bad_alloc& ex)
    {
        std::cout << "2. Exception: " << ex.what() << '\n';
    }
 
    try
    {
        // size is BAD, throw length_error
        s.resize(s.max_size() + 1, 'x');
    }
    catch (const std::length_error& ex)
    {
        std::cout << "3. Length error: " << ex.what() << '\n';
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
Basic functionality:
Shorten:
1. Before: "Where is the end?"
2. After:  "Where is"
Lengthen with a given value 'a':
3. Before: "H"
4. After:  "Haaaaaaa"
Lengthen with char() == 0
5. Before: "Haaaaaaa"
6. After:  "Haaaaaaa@@@"
 
Errors:
1. Exception: std::bad_alloc
2. Exception: std::bad_alloc
3. Length error: basic_string::_M_replace_aux

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 847 | C++98 | there was no exception safety guarantee | added strong exception safety guarantee |
| LWG 2250 | C++98 | the behavior was undefined if count > max_size() is true | always throws an exception in this case |
