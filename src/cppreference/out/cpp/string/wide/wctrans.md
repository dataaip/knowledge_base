| Defined in header `<cwctype>` |  |  |
| std::wctrans_t wctrans( const char\* str ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Constructs a value of type std::wctrans_t that describes a LC_CTYPE category of wide character mapping. It may be one of the standard mappings, or a locale-specific mapping, such as `"tojhira"` or `"tojkata"`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| str | - | C string holding the name of the desired mapping. The following values of `str` are supported in all C locales:   |  |  | | --- | --- | | Value of `str` | Effect | | `"toupper"` | identifies the mapping used by towupper | | `"tolower"` | identifies the mapping used by towlower | |

### Return value

std::wctrans_t object suitable for use with std::towctrans to map wide characters according to the named mapping of the current C locale or zero if str does not name a mapping supported by the current C locale.
