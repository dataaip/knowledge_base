| Defined in header `<cwctype>` |  |  |
| std::wint_t towctrans( std::wint_t ch, std::wctrans_t desc ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Maps the wide character ch using the current C locale's LC_CTYPE mapping category identified by desc.

If the value of ch is neither representable as a wchar_t nor equal to the value of the macro WEOF, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ch | - | the wide character to map |
| desc | - | the LC_CTYPE mapping, obtained from a call to std::wctrans |

### Return value

The mapped value of ch using the mapping identified by desc in LC_CTYPE facet of the current C locale.

### Example

The following example demonstrates katakana to hiragana character mapping.

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <clocale>
#include <cwctype>
#include <iostream>
 
std::wstring tohira(std::wstring str)
{
    std::transform(str.begin(), str.end(), str.begin(), [](wchar_t c)
    {
         return std::towctrans(c, std::wctrans("tojhira"));
    });
    return str;
}
 
int main()
{
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "ja_JP.UTF-8");
    std::wstring kana = L"ヒラガナ";
    std::wcout << "katakana characters " << kana
               << " are " << tohira(kana) << " in hiragana\n";
}

```

Output:

```
katakana characters ヒラガナ are ひらがな in hiragana

```
