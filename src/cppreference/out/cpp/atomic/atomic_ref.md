|  |  |  |

The `std::atomic_ref` class template applies atomic operations to the object it references.

For the lifetime of the `std::atomic_ref` object, the object it references is considered an atomic object. If one thread writes to an atomic object while another thread reads from it, the behavior is well-defined (see memory model for details on data races). In addition, accesses to atomic objects may establish inter-thread synchronization and order non-atomic memory accesses as specified by std::memory_order.

The lifetime of an object must exceed the lifetime of all `std::atomic_ref`s that references the object. While any `std::atomic_ref` instance referencing an object exists, the object must be exclusively accessed through these `std::atomic_ref` instances. No subobject of an object referenced by an `std::atomic_ref` object may be concurrently referenced by any other `std::atomic_ref` object.

Atomic operations applied to an object through an `std::atomic_ref` are atomic with respect to atomic operations applied through any other `std::atomic_ref` referencing the same object.

Like references in the core language, constness is shallow for `std::atomic_ref` - it is possible to modify the referenced value through a const `std::atomic_ref` object.

If any of the following conditions are satisfied, the program is ill-formed:

- std::is_trivially_copyable_v<T> is false.
- `is_always_lock_free` is false and std::is_volatile_v<T> is true.

`std::atomic_ref` is CopyConstructible.

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `value_type` | std::remove_cv_t<T> |
| `difference_type` | - `value_type`, if `T` is an arithmetic type other than **cv** bool. - Otherwise, std::ptrdiff_t, if `T` is a pointer-to-object type. - Otherwise, not defined. |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member | Description |
| T\* `ptr` | the pointer to the referenced object (exposition-only member object\*) |
| is_always_lock_free[static] | indicates that the type is always lock-free   (public static member constant) |
| required_alignment[static] | indicates the required alignment of an object to be referenced by `atomic_ref`   (public static member constant) |

### Member functions

| operator&=operator|=operator^= | atomically performs bitwise AND, OR, XOR with the referenced value   (public member function) |

### Specializations

The standard specifies that `std::atomic_ref` has following specializations:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template<>  struct atomic_ref</\*integral-type\*/>; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| template<>  struct atomic_ref</\*floating-point-type\*/>; | (2) | (since C++20) |
| template< class /\*pointer-type\*/ >  Â  Â  requires /\* see below \*/ struct atomic_ref</\*pointer-type\*/>; | (3) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

1) /\*integral-type\*/ denotes a possibly cv-qualified integral type other than **cv** bool.2) /\*floating-point-type\*/ denotes a possibly cv-qualified floating-point type.3) The partial specialization is provided for /\*pointer-type\*/ types that are possibly cv-qualified pointer-to-object types.

### Notes

Implementations may merge the specified specializations. E.g. MSVC STL merges all of them into the primary template.

When `T` is **cv** void or a function type, std::atomic_ref<T\*> (i.e. std::atomic_ref<void\*>, std::atomic_ref<int(\*)()> etc.) does not have `difference_type` or any operation requiring pointer arithmetic or relational comparison(since C++26).

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_atomic_ref` | `201806L` | (C++20) | `std::atomic_ref` |
| `__cpp_lib_constexpr_atomic` | `202411L` | (C++26) | constexpr std::atomic and `std::atomic_ref` |

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3508 (P3323R1) | C++20 | atomic_ref<T> had unimplementable operations if `T` is a const type or pointer-to-non-object type | these operations are either constained or not provided for unsuitable `T` |
