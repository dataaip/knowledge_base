| std::size_t size() const; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns the number of elements in the valarray.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Number of elements in the valarray.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <valarray>
 
int main()
{
    std::valarray<double> a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    std::cout << "Average: " << a.sum()/a.size() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Average: 5.5

```
