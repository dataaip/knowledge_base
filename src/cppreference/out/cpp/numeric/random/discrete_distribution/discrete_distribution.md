Constructs a new distribution object.

1) Default constructor. Constructs the distribution with a single weight p = {1}. This distribution will always generate ​0​.2) Constructs the distribution with weights in the range ``first`,`last`)`. If first == last, the effects are the same as of the default constructor.3) Constructs the distribution with weights in weights. Effectively calls discrete_distribution(weights.begin(), weights.end()).4) Constructs the distribution with count weights that are generated using function unary_op. Each of the weights is equal to wi = unary_op(xmin + δ(i + 0.5)), where δ = 

|  |
| --- |
| (xmax − xmin) |
| count |

 and i ∈ {0, ..., count − 1}. xmin and xmax must be such that δ > 0. If count == 0 the effects are the same as of the default constructor.5) Constructs the distribution with params as the distribution parameters.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the range of elements defining the numbers to use as weights. The type of the elements referred by `InputIterator` must be convertible to double |
| weights | - | initializer list containing the weights |
| unary_op | - | unary operation function object that will be applied.   The signature of the function should be equivalent to the following:   Ret fun(const Type &a);  The signature does not need to have const &.  The type  Type must be such that an object of type double can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to  Type. The type Ret must be such that an object of type double can be dereferenced and assigned a value of type Ret. ​ |
| params | - | the distribution parameter set |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`InputIt` must meet the requirements of [LegacyInputIterator. | | |
