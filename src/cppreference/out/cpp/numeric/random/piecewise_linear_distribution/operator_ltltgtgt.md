Performs stream input and output operations on pseudo-random number distribution d.

1) Writes a textual representation of the distribution parameters and internal state to ost as textual representation. The formatting flags and fill character of ost are unchanged.2) Restores the distribution parameters and internal state with data read from ist. The formatting flags of ist are unchanged. The data must have been written using a stream with the same locale, `CharT` and `Traits` template parameters, otherwise the behavior is undefined. If bad input is encountered, ist.setstate(std::ios::failbit) is called, which may throw std::ios_base::failure. d is unchanged in that case.

These function templates are not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::piecewise_linear_distribution<ResultType> is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ost | - | output stream to insert the data to |
| ist | - | input stream to extract the data from |
| d | - | pseudo-random number distribution |

### Return value

1) ost2) ist

### Exceptions

1) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.2) May throw std::ios_base::failure on bad input.
