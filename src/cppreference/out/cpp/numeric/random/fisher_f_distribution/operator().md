|  |  |  |

Generates random numbers that are distributed according to the associated probability function. The entropy is acquired by calling g.operator().

The first version uses the associated parameter set, the second version uses params. The associated parameter set is not modified.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| g | - | a uniform random bit generator object |
| params | - | distribution parameter set to use instead of the associated one |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`Generator` must meet the requirements of UniformRandomBitGenerator. | | |

### Return value

The generated random number.

### Complexity

Amortized constant number of invocations of g.operator().
