1-3) Computes 2 raised to the given power num. The library provides overloads of `std::exp2` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter.(since C++23)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| S) The SIMD overload performs an element-wise `std::exp2` on v_num. (See **math-floating-point** and **deduced-simd-t** for their definitions.) | (since C++26) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double. | (since C++11) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| num | - | floating-point or integer value |

### Return value

If no errors occur, the base-**2** exponential of num (2num  
) is returned.

If a range error due to overflow occurs, +HUGE_VAL, `+HUGE_VALF`, or `+HUGE_VALL` is returned.

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If the argument is ±0, 1 is returned.
- If the argument is -∞, +0 is returned.
- If the argument is +∞, +∞ is returned.
- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::exp2(num) has the same effect as std::exp2(static_cast<double>(num)).

For integral exponents, it may be preferable to use std::ldexp.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cerrno>
#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
 
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "exp2(4) = " << std::exp2(4) << '\n'
              << "exp2(0.5) = " << std::exp2(0.5) << '\n'
              << "exp2(-4) = " << std::exp2(-4) << '\n';
 
    // special values
    std::cout << "exp2(-0) = " << std::exp2(-0.0) << '\n'
              << "exp2(-Inf) = " << std::exp2(-INFINITY) << '\n';
 
    // error handling
    errno = 0;
    std::feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
    const double inf = std::exp2(1024);
    const bool is_range_error = errno == ERANGE;
 
    std::cout << "exp2(1024) = " << inf << '\n';
    if (is_range_error)
        std::cout << "    errno == ERANGE: " << std::strerror(ERANGE) << '\n';
    if (std::fetestexcept(FE_OVERFLOW))
        std::cout << "    FE_OVERFLOW raised\n";
}

```

Possible output:

```
exp2(4) = 16
exp2(0.5) = 1.41421
exp2(-4) = 0.0625
exp2(-0) = 1
exp2(-Inf) = 0
exp2(1024) = inf
    errno == ERANGE: Numerical result out of range
    FE_OVERFLOW raised

```
