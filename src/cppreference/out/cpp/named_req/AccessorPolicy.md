****AccessorPolicy**** defines how elements are accessed from a given data handle to such elements and an index. It is used as a policy in std::mdspan to specify the access to a reference of an element using an underlying 1D index.

### Requirements

A type `A` satisfies AccessorPolicy if it models `copyable`, and the following are true:

- std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<A>
- std::is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<A>
- std::is_nothrow_swappable_v<A>

And, given the following types and values, the expressions shown in the table below are valid and have the indicated semantics:

#### Legend

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `A` | an accessor policy type |
| `OP` | an offset policy type |
| Value | Definition |
| a | a value of type (possibly const-qualified) `A` |
| p | a value of type (possibly const-qualified) `A::data_handle_type` |
| i, j, n | values of type std::size_t |

#### Member types

| Name | Type | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `A::element_type` | **(unspecified)** | - A complete object type that is not an abstract class type |
| `A::data_handle_type` | **(unspecified)** but the type need not be element_type\* | - Models `copyable` - The following conditions are all true:   - std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<typename A::data_handle_type> - std::is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<typename A::data_handle_type> - std::is_nothrow_swappable_v<typename A::data_handle_type> |
| `A::reference` | **(unspecified)** but the type need not be element_type& | - std::common_reference_with<typename A::reference&&, typename A::element_type&> is true |
| `A::offset_policy` | `OP` | - Satisfies the requirements of AccessorPolicy - std::constructible_from<OP, const A&> is true - typename OPâ€‹::â€‹element_type and typename Aâ€‹::â€‹element_type are the same type |

#### Member functions

| Expression | Return type | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a.access(p, i) | typename A::reference | - The expression is equality-preserving. |
| a.offset(p, i) | typename A::offset_policy::data_handle_type | - A value q such that for b being A::offset_policy(a), and any integer n for which `[`â€‹0â€‹`,`n`)` is an accessible range[[note 1]](AccessorPolicy.html#cite_note-1) of p and a.   - ``â€‹0â€‹`,`n - i`)` is an accessible range of q and b; and - b.access(q, j) provides access to the same element as a.access(p, i + j), for every j in the range `[`â€‹0â€‹`,`n - i`)`.   - The expression is [equality-preserving. |

1. â†‘ A range of indices ``â€‹0â€‹`,`N`)` is an **accessible range** of a given data handle and an accessor if, for each index in the range, the access member function produces a valid reference to an element.

### Standard library

The following standard library types satisfy AccessorPolicy requirements:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [default_accessor(C++23) | a type for indexed access to elements of `mdspan`   (class template) |
| aligned_accessor")(C++26) | a type for aligned access to elements of `mdspan`   (class template) |
| Defined in namespace `std::linalg` | |
| scaled_accessor")(C++26) | std::mdspan accessor policy whose reference represents the product of a scaling factor that is fixed and its nested std::mdspan accessor's reference   (class template) |
| conjugated_accessor")(C++26) | std::mdspan accessor policy whose reference represents the complex conjugate of its nested std::mdspan accessor's reference   (class template) |
