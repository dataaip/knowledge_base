A ****UnaryTypeTrait**** is a class template that describes a property of its template type parameter with an std::integral_constant (typically std::bool_constant) specialization.

### Requirements

- DefaultConstructible and CopyConstructible.
- Takes one template type parameter (additional template parameters are optional and allowed).
- Publicly and unambiguously derived from a specialization of std::integral_constant, known as its **base characteristic**.
- The member names of the **base characteristic** are not hidden and are unambiguously available.

### Standard library

The following type traits all satisfy UnaryTypeTrait:

- Primary type categories
- Composite type categories
- Type properties
- Supported operations
- Property queries

The following standard library class templates also satisfy UnaryTypeTrait.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| integral_constant(C++11) | compile-time constant of specified type with specified value   (class template) |
| negation(C++17) | logical NOT metafunction   (class template) |
| std::tuple_size<std::tuple>(C++11) | obtains the size of a `tuple`   (class template specialization) |
| std::tuple_size<std::array>(C++11) | obtains the size of an `array`   (class template specialization) |
| std::tuple_size<std::pair>(C++11) | obtains the size of a `pair`   (class template specialization) |
| variant_sizevariant_size_v(C++17) | obtains the size of the `variant`'s list of alternatives at compile time (class template) (variable template) |
| is_bind_expression(C++11) | indicates that an object is `std::bind` expression or can be used as one   (class template) |
| is_placeholder(C++11) | indicates that an object is a standard placeholder or can be used as one   (class template) |
| is_execution_policy(C++17) | test whether a class represents an execution policy   (class template) |
