Specifies that an instance of the type can be assigned from an rvalue argument.

### Requirements

The type `T` satisfies MoveAssignable if

Given

- `t`, a modifiable lvalue expression of type `T`,
- `rv`, an rvalue expression of type `T`.

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects.

| Expression | Return type | Return value | Post-conditions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| t = rv | `T&` | `t` | If `t` and `rv` do not refer to the same object, the value of `t` is equivalent to the value of `rv` before the assignment. The new value of `rv` is unspecified. |

### Notes

The type does not have to implement move assignment operator in order to satisfy this type requirement: a copy assignment operator that takes its parameter by value or as a `const Type&`, will bind to rvalue argument.

If a MoveAssignable class implements a move assignment operator, it may also implement move semantics to take advantage of the fact that the value of `rv` after assignment is unspecified.
