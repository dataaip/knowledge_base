A ****TransformationTrait**** is a class template that provides a transformation of its template type parameter.

### Requirements

- Takes one template type parameter (additional template parameters are optional and allowed).
- The transformed type is a publicly accessible nested type named type.

### Standard library

All type transformation traits satisfy ****TransformationTrait****.

The following standard library class templates also satisfy ****TransformationTrait****.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::tuple_element<std::tuple>(C++11) | obtains the type of the specified element   (class template specialization) |
| std::tuple_element<std::pair>(C++11) | obtains the type of the elements of `pair`   (class template specialization) |
| std::tuple_element<std::array>(C++11) | obtains the type of the elements of `array`   (class template specialization) |
| variant_alternativevariant_alternative_t(C++17) | obtains the type of the alternative specified by its index, at compile time (class template) (alias template) |
