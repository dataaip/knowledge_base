A ****LegacyContiguousIterator**** is a LegacyIterator whose logically adjacent elements are also physically adjacent in memory.

A pointer to an element of an array satisfies all requirements of LegacyContiguousIterator.

### Requirements

The type It satisfies LegacyContiguousIterator if

- The type It satisfies LegacyIterator

And, for every

- a, a dereferenceable iterator of type It
- n, an integral value

such that

- a + n is a valid and dereferenceable iterator value

then

- \*(a + n) is equivalent to \*(std::addressof(\*a) + n).

### Standard library

The following standard library types are ****LegacyContiguousIterators****.

- array::iterator.
- basic_string_view::iterator.
- basic_string::iterator.
- vector::iterator for `value_type` other than bool.
- The return type of begin(valarray) and end(valarray).

### Notes

Fancy pointer to object types are also required to satisfy LegacyContiguousIterator.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| LegacyContiguousIterator is replaced with the `contiguous_iterator` concept: iterator types in the standard library that are required to satisfy LegacyContiguousIterator in C++17 are required to model `contiguous_iterator` in C++20. | (since C++20) |

### See also

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| contiguous_iterator(C++20) | specifies that a `random_access_iterator` is a contiguous iterator, referring to elements that are contiguous in memory   (concept) |
| ****Iterator library**** | provides definitions for iterators, iterator traits, adaptors, and utility functions |
