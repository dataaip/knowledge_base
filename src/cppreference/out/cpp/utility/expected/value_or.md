| Primary template |  |  |

| template< class U >   constexpr T value_or( U&& default_value ) &&; | (2) | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the expected value if it exists, otherwise returns default_value.

The void partial specialization does not have these member functions.

1) If std::is_copy_constructible_v<T> or std::is_convertible_v<U, T> is false, the program is ill-formed.2) If std::is_move_constructible_v<T> or std::is_convertible_v<U, T> is false, the program is ill-formed.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| default_value | - | the value to use in case \*this does not contain an expected value |

### Return value

1) has_value() ? \*\*this : static_cast<T>(std::forward<U>(default_value))2) has_value() ? std::move(\*\*this) : static_cast<T>(std::forward<U>(default_value))
