If \*this represents an expected value, invokes f and returns its result. Otherwise, returns a `std::expected` object that contains an unexpected value, which is initialized with the unexpected value of \*this.

1-4) f is invoked with the expected value `val` as the argument.5-8) f is invoked without any argument.

Given type `U` as:

1,2) std::remove_cvref_t<std::invoke_result_t<F, decltype((`val`))>>3,4) std::remove_cvref_t<std::invoke_result_t<F, decltype(std::move(`val`))>>5-8) std::remove_cvref_t<std::invoke_result_t<F>>

If `U` is not a specialization of `std::expected`, or std::is_same_v<U::error_type, E> is false, the program is ill-formed.

1,2) These overloads participate in overload resolution only if std::is_constructible_v<E, decltype(error())> is true.3,4) These overloads participate in overload resolution only if std::is_constructible_v<E, decltype(std::move(error()))> is true.5,6) These overloads participate in overload resolution only if std::is_constructible_v<E, decltype(error())> is true.7,8) These overloads participate in overload resolution only if std::is_constructible_v<E, decltype(std::move(error()))> is true.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| f | - | a suitable function or Callable object that returns a std::expected |

### Return value

| Overload | Value of `has_value()` | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| true | false |
| (1,2) | std::invoke(std::forward<F>(f),`val`) | U(std::unexpect, error()) |
| (3,4) | std::invoke(std::forward<F>(f),std::move(`val`)) | U(std::unexpect, std::move(error())) |
| (5,6) | std::invoke(std::forward<F>(f)) | U(std::unexpect, error()) |
| (7,8) | U(std::unexpect, std::move(error())) |

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3938 | C++23 | the expected value was obtained by value()[[1]](and_then.html#cite_note-1) | changed to \*\*this |
| LWG 3973 | C++23 | the expected value was obtained by \*\*this[[2]](and_then.html#cite_note-2) | changed to `val` |

1. ↑ `value()` requires `E` to be copy constructible (see LWG issue 3843), where `operator*` does not.
2. ↑ \*\*this can trigger argument-dependent lookup.
