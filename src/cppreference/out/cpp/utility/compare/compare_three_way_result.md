| Defined in header `<compare>` |  |  |
| template< class T, class U = T >  struct compare_three_way_result; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Let `t` and `u` denote lvalue of const std::remove_reference_t<T> and const std::remove_reference_t<U> respectively, if the expression t <=> u is well-formed, provides the member typedef `type` equal to decltype(t <=> u), otherwise there is no member `type`.

If the program adds specializations for `std::compare_three_way_result`, the behavior is undefined.

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Definition |
| `type` | the result type of operator<=> on const-qualified lvalue of `T` and `U` |

### Helper types

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template< class T, class U = T >  using compare_three_way_result_t = compare_three_way_result<T, U>::type; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text // recommended by Casey Carter // see also: https://github.com/microsoft/STL/pull/385#discussion_r357894054 template<class T, class U = T> using compare_three_way_result_t = decltype(     std::declval<const std::remove_reference_t<T>&>() <=>     std::declval<const std::remove_reference_t<U>&>() );   template<class T, class U = T> struct compare_three_way_result {};   template<class T, class U>     requires requires { typename compare_three_way_result_t<T, U>; } struct compare_three_way_result<T, U> {     using type = compare_three_way_result_t<T, U>; }; ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <compare>
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>
 
template<class Ord>
void print_cmp_type()
{
    if constexpr (std::is_same_v<Ord, std::strong_ordering>)
        std::cout << "strong ordering\n";
    else if constexpr (std::is_same_v<Ord, std::weak_ordering>)
        std::cout << "weak ordering\n";
    else if constexpr (std::is_same_v<Ord, std::partial_ordering>)
        std::cout << "partial ordering\n";
    else
        std::cout << "illegal comparison result type\n";
}
 
int main()
{
    print_cmp_type<std::compare_three_way_result_t<int>>();
    print_cmp_type<std::compare_three_way_result_t<double>>();
}

```

Output:

```
strong ordering
partial ordering

```
