| Defined in header `<stacktrace>` |  |  |
| class stacktrace_entry; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

The `stacktrace_entry` class provides operations for querying information about an evaluation in a stacktrace. Each `stacktrace_entry` object is either empty, or represents an evaluation in a stacktrace.

`stacktrace_entry` models std::regular and std::three_way_comparable<std::strong_ordering>.

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `native_handle_type` | implementation-defined native handle type |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a new `stacktrace_entry`   (public member function) |
| (destructor) | destroys the `stacktrace_entry`   (public member function) |
| operator= | assigns the contents of one `stacktrace_entry` to another   (public member function) |
| Observers | |
| native_handle | gets the implementation-defined native handle of the `stacktrace_entry`   (public member function) |
| operator bool | checks whether the `stacktrace_entry` is empty   (public member function) |
| Query | |
| description | gets the description of the evaluation represented by the `stacktrace_entry`   (public member function) |
| source_file | gets the name of the source file that lexically contains the expression or statement whose evaluation is represented by the `stacktrace_entry`   (public member function) |
| source_line | gets the line number that lexically relates the evaluation represented by the `stacktrace_entry`   (public member function) |

### Non-member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator==operator<=>(C++23) | compares two `stacktrace_entry` values   (function) |
| to_string(C++23) | returns a string with a description of the `stacktrace_entry`   (function) |
| operator<<(C++23) | performs stream output of `stacktrace_entry`   (function template) |

### Helper classes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::hash<std::stacktrace_entry>(C++23) | hash support for ****std::stacktrace_entry****   (class template specialization) |
| std::formatter<std::stacktrace_entry>(C++23) | formatting support for `stacktrace_entry`   (class template specialization) |

### Notes

`boost::stacktrace::frame` (available in Boost.Stacktrace) can be used instead when `std::stacktrace_entry` is not available.
