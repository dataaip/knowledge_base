Creates a new `std::copyable_function`.

1,2) Default constructor and the constructor taking nullptr construct an empty `std::copyable_function`.3) Copy constructor constructs a `std::copyable_function` whose target is a copy of the target of other. Otherwise, constructs an empty `std::copyable_function` if other is empty.4) Move constructor constructs a `std::copyable_function` whose target is that of other. other is in a valid but unspecified state after move construction.5) Let `VT` be std::decay_t<F>. If f is a null function pointer, a null pointer to member value, or an empty `std::copyable_function` (may be any other specialization), then constructs an empty `std::copyable_function`. Otherwise, constructs a `std::copyable_function` whose target is of type `VT` and direct-non-list-initialized with std::forward<F>(f).

- This overload participates in overload resolution only if `VT` is neither same as `copyable_function` nor a specialization of std::in_place_type_t, and /\*is-callable-from\*/<VT> (see below) is true.
- The program is ill-formed if std::is_constructible_v<VT, F> or std::is_copy_constructible_v<VT> is not true.
6) Let `VT` be std::decay_t<T>. Constructs a `std::copyable_function` whose target is of type `VT` and direct-non-list-initialized with std::forward<CArgs>(args)....

- This overload participates in overload resolution only if both std::is_constructible_v<VT, CArgs...> and /\*is-callable-from\*/<VT> (see below) are true.
- The program is ill-formed if `VT` is not the same type as `T` or std::is_copy_constructible_v<VT> is not true.
7) Let `VT` be std::decay_t<T>. Constructs a `std::copyable_function` whose target is of type `VT` and direct-non-list-initialized with il, std::forward<CArgs>(args)....

- This overload participates in overload resolution only if both std::is_constructible_v<VT, std::initializer_list<U>&, CArgs...> and /\*is-callable-from\*/<VT> (see below) are true.
- The program is ill-formed if `VT` is not the same type as `T` or std::is_copy_constructible_v<VT> is not true.

For constructors (5-7), the behavior is undefined unless `VT` satisfies both Destructible and CopyConstructible requirements.

The constant /\*is-callable-from\*/<VT> is dependent on cv, ref, and noex in the template parameter of `std::copyable_function` as below:

| const && noexcept(false) | std::is_invocable_r_v<R, const VT, Args...> |
| const && noexcept(true) | std::is_nothrow_invocable_r_v<R, const VT, Args...> |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | another `std::copyable_function` to copy or move from |
| f | - | a function or a Callable object to wrap |
| args | - | arguments to construct the target object |
| il | - | std::initializer_list to construct the target object |

### Exceptions

3) May throw std::bad_alloc on allocation failure or propagate the exception thrown by the initialization of the target.5-7) May throw std::bad_alloc on allocation failure or propagate the exception thrown by the initialization of the target. No exception is thrown if `VT` is a function pointer type or a specialization of std::reference_wrapper.
