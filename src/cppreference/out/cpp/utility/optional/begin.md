If \*this contains a value, returns an iterator to the contained value. Otherwise, a past-the-end iterator value.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Iterator to the contained value if has_value() is true. Otherwise, a past-the-end iterator.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_optional_range_support` | `202406L` | (C++26) | Range support for `std::optional` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <optional>
#include <print>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr std::optional<int> none = std::nullopt;
    constexpr std::optional<int> some = 42;
 
    static_assert(none.begin() == none.end());
    static_assert(some.begin() != some.end());
 
    // ranged-for loop support
    for (int i : none)
        std::println("'none' has a value of {}", i);
 
    for (int i : some)
        std::println("'some' has a value of {}", i);
 
    std::optional<std::vector<int>> many({0, 1, 2});
    for (const auto& v : many)
        std::println("'many' has a value of {}", v);
}

```

Output:

```
'some' has a value of 42
'many' has a value of [0, 1, 2]

```
