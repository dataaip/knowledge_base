| template< class T, class... Args >  constexpr std::optional<T> make_optional( Args&&... args ); | (2) | (since C++17) |

|  |  |  |

1) Creates an optional object from value. Effectively calls std::optional<std::decay_t<T>>(std::forward<T>(value)).2) Creates an optional object constructed in-place from args.... Equivalent to return std::optional<T>(std::in_place, std::forward<Args>(args)...);.  
This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_constructible_v<T, Args...> is true.3) Creates an optional object constructed in-place from il and args.... Equivalent to return std::optional<T>(std::in_place, il, std::forward<Args>(args)...);.  
This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_constructible_v<T, std::initializer_list<U>&, Args...> is true.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | - | the value to construct optional object with |
| il, args | - | arguments to be passed to the constructor of `T` |

### Return value

The constructed optional object.

### Exceptions

Throws any exception thrown by the constructor of `T`.

### Notes

`T` need not be movable for overloads (2,3) due to guaranteed copy elision.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <optional>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    auto op1 = std::make_optional<std::vector<char>>({'a','b','c'});
    std::cout << "op1: ";
    for (char c : op1.value())
        std::cout << c << ',';
    auto op2 = std::make_optional<std::vector<int>>(5, 2);
    std::cout << "\nop2: ";
    for (int i : *op2)
        std::cout << i << ',';
    std::string str{"hello world"};
    auto op3 = std::make_optional<std::string>(std::move(str));
    std::cout << "\nop3: " << std::quoted(op3.value_or("empty value")) << '\n';
    std::cout << "str: " << std::quoted(str) << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
op1: a,b,c,
op2: 2,2,2,2,2,
op3: "hello world"
str: ""

```
