| Defined in header `<format>` |  |  |
| enum class range_format {      disabled,      map,      set,      sequence,      string,      debug_string }; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Specifies how a range should be formatted.

### Constants

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Explanation |
| `disabled` | disallows range default formatter to format range |
| `map` | allows to format range as map representation with modified brackets "{", "}" and separator ": " for underlying **pair-like** types in the following format: { key-1 : value-1, ..., key-n : value-n } |
| `set` | allows to format range as set representation with modified brackets "{" and "}" in the following format: { key-1, ..., key-n } |
| `sequence` | allows to format range as sequence representation with default brackets "[", "]" and separator ", " in the following format: [ element-1, ..., element-n ] |
| `string` | allows to format range as string |
| `debug_string` | allows to format range as escaped string |
