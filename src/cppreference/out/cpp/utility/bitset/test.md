| bool test( std::size_t pos ) const; |  | (constexpr since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the value of the bit at the position pos (counting from 0).

Unlike [operator[]](operator_at.html "cpp/utility/bitset/operator at"), it performs a bounds check.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | - | position of the bit to return (counting from 0) |

### Return value

true if the requested bit is set, false otherwise.

### Exceptions

Throws std::out_of_range if pos does not correspond to a valid bit position.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <bit>
#include <bitset>
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
 
int main()
{
    std::bitset<10> b1("1111010000");
 
    std::size_t idx = 0;
    while (idx < b1.size() && !b1.test(idx))
        ++idx;
 
    assert(static_cast<int>(idx) == std::countr_zero(b1.to_ulong()));
 
    if (idx < b1.size())
        std::cout << "The first set bit is at index " << idx << '\n';
    else
        std::cout << "no set bits\n";
 
    try
    {
        std::bitset<0B10'1001'1010> bad;
        if (bad.test(bad.size()))
            std::cout << "Expect unexpected!\n";
    }
    catch (std::out_of_range const& ex)
    {
        std::cout << "Exception: " << ex.what() << '\n';
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
The first set bit is at index 4
Exception: bitset::test: __position (which is 666) >= _Nb (which is 666)

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2250 | C++98 | the behavior was undefined if pos does not correspond to a valid bit position | always throws an exception in this case |
