| bitset& flip( std::size_t pos ); | (2) | (constexpr since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Flips bits, i.e. changes true values to false and false values to true. Equivalent to a logical NOT operation on part or all of the bitset.

1) Flips all bits (like operator~, but in-place).2) Flips the bit at the position pos.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | - | the position of the bit to flip |

### Return value

\*this

### Exceptions

2) Throws std::out_of_range if pos does not correspond to a valid bit position.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::bitset<4> flops;
 
    std::cout << flops << '\n'
              << flops.flip(0) << '\n'
              << flops.flip(2) << '\n'
              << flops.flip() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
0000
0001
0101
1010

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2250 | C++98 | the behavior was undefined if pos does not correspond to a valid bit position | always throws an exception in this case |
