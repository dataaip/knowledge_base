Provides several function templates to access, manipulate, and process individual bits and bit sequences.

| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<bit>` | |
| Defined in namespace `std` | |
| bit_cast(C++20) | reinterpret the object representation of one type as that of another   (function template) |
| byteswap(C++23) | reverses the bytes in the given integer value   (function template) |
| Integral powers of 2 | |
| has_single_bit(C++20) | checks if a number is an integral power of 2   (function template) |
| bit_ceil(C++20) | finds the smallest integral power of 2 not less than the given value   (function template) |
| bit_floor(C++20) | finds the largest integral power of 2 not greater than the given value   (function template) |
| bit_width(C++20) | finds the smallest number of bits needed to represent the given value   (function template) |
| Rotating | |
| rotl(C++20) | computes the result of bitwise left-rotation   (function template) |
| rotr(C++20) | computes the result of bitwise right-rotation   (function template) |
| Counting | |
| countl_zero(C++20) | counts the number of consecutive ​0​ bits, starting from the most significant bit   (function template) |
| countl_one(C++20) | counts the number of consecutive 1 bits, starting from the most significant bit   (function template) |
| countr_zero(C++20) | counts the number of consecutive ​0​ bits, starting from the least significant bit   (function template) |
| countr_one(C++20) | counts the number of consecutive 1 bits, starting from the least significant bit   (function template) |
| popcount(C++20) | counts the number of 1 bits in an unsigned integer   (function template) |
| Endian | |
| endian(C++20) | indicates the endianness of scalar types   (enum) |
