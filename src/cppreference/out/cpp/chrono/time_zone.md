| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| class time_zone; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The class `time_zone` represents all time zone transitions for a specific geographic area.

Users cannot construct `time_zone` objects. The library implementation creates `time_zone` objects when it initializes the time zone database and provides const access to these objects.

`time_zone` is not copyable but does have a defaulted move constructor and a defaulted move assignment operator. However, as users have only const access to `time_zone` objects, these functions cannot be called in user code without invoking undefined behavior.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| name | obtains the name of this `time_zone`   (public member function) |
| get_info | obtain information associated with a sys_time or local_time   (public member function) |
| to_sys | converts a local_time in this time zone to a sys_time   (public member function) |
| to_local | converts a sys_time to a local_time in this time zone   (public member function) |

### Nonmember functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator==operator<=>(C++20) | compares two `time_zone` objects   (function) |
