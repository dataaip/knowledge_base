| template< class CharT, class Traits >  std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&      operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os, const std::chrono::weekday_indexed& wdi ); |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Outputs a textual representation of wdi into the stream os, as if by:

if (wdi.index() >=1 && wdi.index() <= 5)  
    os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}[{}]"),  
                      wdi.weekday(), wdi.index());  
else  
    os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}[{} is not a valid index]"),  
                      wdi.weekday(), wdi.index());

where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("...") is "..." if `CharT` is char, and L"..." if `CharT` is wchar_t.

### Return value

os
