Returns a zero-length duration.

If the representation `rep` of the duration requires some other implementation to return a zero-length duration, std::chrono::duration_values can be specialized to return the desired value.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Returns duration(std::chrono::duration_values<rep>::zero()).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <ratio>
 
template<typename X, typename Y>
using dura = std::chrono::duration<X, Y>;
 
static_assert
(
    (std::chrono::hours::zero() == std::chrono::nanoseconds::zero()) &&
    (dura<short, std::nano>::zero() == dura<int, std::deci>::zero()) &&
    (dura<short, std::deca>::zero() == dura<long, std::exa>::zero()) &&
    (dura<long, std::atto>::zero().count() == dura<float, std::exa>::zero().count())
);
 
int main() {}

```
