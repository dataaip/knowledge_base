| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| template<  class CharT,      class Traits,      class Rep,      class Period  > std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&      operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os, const std::chrono::duration<Rep, Period>& d ); |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Inserts a textual representation of d into os.

Behaves as if it was implemented as

```
std::basic_ostringstream<CharT, Traits> s;
s.flags(os.flags());
s.imbue(os.getloc());
s.precision(os.precision());
s << d.count() << units_suffix; // see below
return os << s.str();

```

In other words, the stream flags, locale, and precision are determined by the stream, but any padding are determined using the entire output string.

The `units_suffix` is determined based on `Period::type` according to the following table.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `Period::type` | Suffix |
| std::atto | `as` |
| std::femto | `fs` |
| std::pico | `ps` |
| std::nano | `ns` |
| std::micro | `µs` (U+00B5) or `us`, it is implementation-defined which one is used |
| std::milli | `ms` |
| std::centi | `cs` |
| std::deci | `ds` |
| std::ratio<1> | `s` |
| std::deca | `das` |
| std::hecto | `hs` |
| std::kilo | `ks` |
| std::mega | `Ms` |
| std::giga | `Gs` |
| std::tera | `Ts` |
| std::peta | `Ps` |
| std::exa | `Es` |
| std::ratio<60> | `min` |
| std::ratio<3600> | `h` |
| std::ratio<86400> | `d` |
| None of the above, and Period::type::den == 1 | `[num]s` |
| None of the above | `[num/den]s` |

For the last two rows of the table, `num` and `den` in the suffix are `Period::type::num` and `Period::type::den` formatted as a decimal number with no leading zeroes, respectively.

### Return value

A reference to the stream, i.e., os.

### Example

This example shows the output of `std::chrono::operator<<` when given a duration:

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
int main()
{
    constexpr auto duration = 123ms;
    std::cout << duration << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
123ms

```
