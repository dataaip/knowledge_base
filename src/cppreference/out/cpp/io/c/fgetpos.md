| Defined in header `<cstdio>` |  |  |
| int fgetpos( std::FILE\* stream, std::fpos_t\* pos ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Obtains the file position indicator and the current parse state (if any) for the file stream `stream` and stores them in the object pointed to by `pos`. The value stored is only meaningful as the input to std::fsetpos.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stream | - | file stream to examine |
| pos | - | pointer to a fpos_t object to store the file position indicator to |

### Return value

​0​ upon success, nonzero value otherwise. Also sets errno on failure.
