| enum event { erase_event, imbue_event, copyfmt_event }; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Specifies the event type which is passed to functions registered by register_callback() on specific events. The following constants are defined:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Constant | Explanation |
| `erase_event` | issued on ~ios_base() or basic_ios::copyfmt() (before the copy of members takes place) |
| `imbue_event` | issued on imbue() |
| `copyfmt_event` | issued on basic_ios::copyfmt() (after the copy of members takes place, but before the exception settings are copied) |
