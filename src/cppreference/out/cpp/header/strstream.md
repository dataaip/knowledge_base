### Notes

****<strstream>**** is deprecated in C++98 and removed in C++26 (see P2867R1).

The reason for removal is that C++20 and C++23 provide superior replacement facilities, such as the ability to move strings efficiently out of std::stringstreams (since C++20, see P0408R7), and the <spanstream> library (since C++23, see P0448R4).
