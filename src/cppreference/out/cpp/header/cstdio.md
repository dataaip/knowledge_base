This header was originally in the C standard library as <stdio.h>.

This header is part of the C-style input/output library.

| size_t | unsigned integer type returned by the sizeof operator   (typedef) |
| Macros | |
| NULL | implementation-defined null pointer constant   (macro constant) |
| stdinstdoutstderr | expression of type FILE\* associated with the input stream expression of type FILE\* associated with the output stream expression of type FILE\* associated with the error output stream   (macro constant) |

| SEEK_SETSEEK_CURSEEK_END | argument to std::fseek indicating seeking from beginning of the file argument to std::fseek indicating seeking from the current file position argument to std::fseek indicating seeking from end of the file   (macro constant) |
| TMP_MAX | maximum number of unique filenames that can be generated by std::tmpnam   (macro constant) |
| L_tmpnam | size needed for an array of char to hold the result of std::tmpnam   (macro constant) |
