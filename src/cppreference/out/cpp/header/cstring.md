This header was originally in the C standard library as <string.h>.

This header is for C-style null-terminated byte strings.

### Macros

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| NULL | implementation-defined null pointer constant   (macro constant) |

### Types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| size_t | unsigned integer type returned by the sizeof operator   (typedef) |

### Functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| String manipulation | |
| strcpy | copies one string to another   (function) |
| strncpy | copies a certain amount of characters from one string to another   (function) |
| strcat | concatenates two strings   (function) |
| strncat | concatenates a certain amount of characters of two strings   (function) |
| strxfrm | transform a string so that `strcmp` would produce the same result as `strcoll`   (function) |
| String examination | |
| strlen | returns the length of a given string   (function) |
| strcmp | compares two strings   (function) |
| strncmp | compares a certain number of characters from two strings   (function) |
| strcoll | compares two strings in accordance to the current locale   (function) |
| strchr | finds the first occurrence of a character   (function) |
| strrchr | finds the last occurrence of a character   (function) |
| strspn | returns the length of the maximum initial segment that consists of only the characters found in another byte string   (function) |
| strcspn | returns the length of the maximum initial segment that consists of only the characters not found in another byte string   (function) |
| strpbrk | finds the first location of any character from a set of separators   (function) |
| strstr | finds the first occurrence of a substring of characters   (function) |
| strtok | finds the next token in a byte string   (function) |
| Character array manipulation | |
| memchr | searches an array for the first occurrence of a character   (function) |
| memcmp | compares two buffers   (function) |
| memset | fills a buffer with a character   (function) |
| memcpy | copies one buffer to another   (function) |
| memmove | moves one buffer to another   (function) |
| Miscellaneous | |
| strerror | returns a text version of a given error code   (function) |
