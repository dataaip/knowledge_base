| template< class F, class... Args >  concept predicate =      std::regular_invocable<F, Args...> && boolean-testable<std::invoke_result_t<F, Args...>>; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The concept std::predicate<F, Args...> specifies that `F` is a predicate that accepts arguments whose types and value categories are encoded by `Args...`, i.e., it can be invoked with these arguments to produce a `boolean-testable` result.

Note that `regular_invocable` requires the invocation to not modify either the callable object or the arguments and be equality-preserving.

### Equality preservation

Expressions declared in requires expressions of the standard library concepts are required to be equality-preserving (except where stated otherwise).
