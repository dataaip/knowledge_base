| template< class B >  concept __boolean_testable_impl = std::convertible_to<B, bool>; | (1) | (since C++20)  (exposition only\*) |
| template< class B >  concept boolean-testable =      __boolean_testable_impl<B> &&      requires (B&& b) {          { !std::forward<B>(b) } -> __boolean_testable_impl; }; | (2) | (since C++20)  (exposition only\*) |

The exposition-only concept `boolean-testable` specifies the requirements for expressions that are convertible to bool and for which the logical operators have the usual behavior (including short-circuiting), even for two different `boolean-testable` types.

Formally, to model the exposition-only concept `__boolean_testable_impl`, the type must not define any member operator&& and operator||, and no viable non-member operator&& and operator|| may be visible by argument-dependent lookup. Additionally, given an expression `e` such that decltype((e)) is `B`, `boolean-testable` is modeled only if bool(e) == !bool(!e).

### Equality preservation

Expressions declared in requires expressions of the standard library concepts are required to be equality-preserving (except where stated otherwise).

### Notes

Examples of `boolean-testable` types include bool, std::true_type, std::bitset<N>::reference, and int\*.
