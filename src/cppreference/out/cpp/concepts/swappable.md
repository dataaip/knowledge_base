The concept `swappable<T>` specifies that lvalues of type `T` are swappable.

The concept `swappable_with<T, U>` specifies that expressions of the type and value category encoded by `T` and `U` are swappable with each other. `swappable_with<T, U>` is satisfied only if a call to ranges::swap(t, u) exchanges the value of `t` and `u`, that is, given distinct objects `t2` equal to `t` and `u2` equal to `u`, after evaluating either ranges::swap(t, u) or ranges::swap(u, t), `t2` is equal to `u` and `u2` is equal to `t`.

### Equality preservation

Expressions declared in requires expressions of the standard library concepts are required to be equality-preserving (except where stated otherwise).
