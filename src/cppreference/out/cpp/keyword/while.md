### Usage

- while loop: as the declaration of the loop
- do-while loop: as the declaration of the terminating condition of the loop

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
 
int main() noexcept
{
    int i{3};
 
    // The following 'while' loop statement:
    // 1. (condition) Checks if value of the variable 'i' is greater than zero
    //                and if not, ends the loop execution with end of this point.
    //                Post-decrements the variable 'i' (decreases its value by 1).
    // 2. (statement) Writes out a current value of the variable 'i' to the stdout.
    // 3.             Returns to the point 1 (condition).
 
    while (i --> 0)     // condition: i-- > 0
        std::cout << i; // statement: std::cout << i;
}

```

Output:

```
210

```
