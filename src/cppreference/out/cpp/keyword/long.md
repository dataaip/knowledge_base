### Usage

- `long` type modifier

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <climits>
#include <concepts>
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
#include <locale>
Â 
static_assert(
    sizeof(long) >= 32 / CHAR_BIT &&
    sizeof(unsigned long) >= 32 / CHAR_BIT &&
    std::numeric_limits<long>::min() <= -2'147'483'647l - 1 && //'
    std::numeric_limits<long>::max() >= 2'147'483'647l && //'
    std::numeric_limits<unsigned long>::max() >= 4'294'967'295ul); //'
Â 
// 'long long' and 'unsigned long long' are available since C++11
static_assert(
    sizeof(long long) >= 64 / CHAR_BIT &&
    sizeof(unsigned long long) >= 64 / CHAR_BIT &&
    std::numeric_limits<long long>::min() <= -9'223'372'036'854'775'807ll - 1 &&
    std::numeric_limits<long long>::max() >= 9'223'372'036'854'775'807ll &&
    std::numeric_limits<unsigned long long>::max() >= 18'446'744'073'709'551'615ull);
Â 
// concepts are available since C++20
static_assert(
    std::integral<long> &&
    std::integral<long long> &&
    std::integral<unsigned long> &&
    std::integral<unsigned long long> &&
    std::floating_point<long double>);
// Note that 'long' cannot modify 'float'
Â 
static_assert(
    std::same_as<decltype(0l), signed long int> &&
    std::same_as<decltype(0ll), signed long long int> &&
    std::same_as<decltype(0ul), unsigned long int> &&
    std::same_as<decltype(0ull), unsigned long long int> &&
    std::same_as<decltype(0.l), long double>);
Â 
template <typename T, typename... Ts>
concept all_same = (... and std::same_as <T, Ts>);
Â 
static_assert(
    all_same<long, long int, signed long, signed long int> &&
    all_same<unsigned long, unsigned long int> &&
    all_same<long long, long long int, signed long long, signed long long int> &&
    all_same<unsigned long long, unsigned long long int>);
Â 
#define OUT(...) std::cout << #__VA_ARGS__ << " = " << __VA_ARGS__ << '\n'
Â 
int main()
{
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
Â 
    OUT(sizeof(long));
    OUT(std::numeric_limits<long>::min());
    OUT(std::numeric_limits<long>::max());
    OUT(std::numeric_limits<unsigned long>::max());
Â 
    OUT(sizeof(long long));
    OUT(std::numeric_limits<long long>::min());
    OUT(std::numeric_limits<long long>::max());
    OUT(std::numeric_limits<unsigned long long>::max());
}
Â 
#undef OUT

```

Possible output:

```
sizeof(long) = 8
std::numeric_limits<long>::min() = -9,223,372,036,854,775,808
std::numeric_limits<long>::max() = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
std::numeric_limits<unsigned long>::max() = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
sizeof(long long) = 8
std::numeric_limits<long long>::min() = -9,223,372,036,854,775,808
std::numeric_limits<long long>::max() = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
std::numeric_limits<unsigned long long>::max() = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
