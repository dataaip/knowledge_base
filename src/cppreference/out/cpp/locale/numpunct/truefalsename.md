1,2) Public member function, calls the member function `do_truename` and `do_falsename` of the most derived class respectively.3) Returns the string to be used as the representation of the boolean value true.4) Returns the string to be used as the representation of the boolean value false.

### Return value

1,3) The object of type `string_type` to use as the representation of true. The standard specializations of `std::numpunct` return "true" and L"true".2,4) The object of type `string_type` to use as the representation of false. The standard specializations of `std::numpunct` return "false" and L"false".

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
struct custom_tf : std::numpunct<char>
{
    std::string do_truename()  const { return {'t'}; }
    std::string do_falsename() const { return {'f'}; }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
 
    // default boolalpha output
    std::cout << "Default locale,\n"
                 "  boolalpha  true: " << true << "\n"
                 "  boolalpha false: " << false << "\n\n";
 
    // with custom_tf applied to locale
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale(std::cout.getloc(), new custom_tf));
    std::cout << "Locale with modified numpunct,\n"
                 "  boolalpha  true: " << true << "\n"
                 "  boolalpha false: " << false << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Default locale,
  boolalpha  true: true
  boolalpha false: false
 
Locale with modified numpunct,
  boolalpha  true: t
  boolalpha false: f

```
