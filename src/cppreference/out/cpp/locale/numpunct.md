The facet `std::numpunct` encapsulates numeric punctuation preferences. Stream I/O operations use `std::numpunct` through std::num_get and std::num_put for parsing numeric input and formatting numeric output.

The numbers that are supported by `std::numpunct` have the format described below. Here `digit` represents the radix set specified by the `fmtflags` argument value, `thousands-sep` and `decimal-point` are the results of thousands_sep() and decimal_point() functions respectively.

The format of integer values is as follows:

```
integer     ::= [sign] units
sign        ::= plusminus
plusminus   ::= '+' | '-'
units       ::= digits [thousands-sep units]
digits      ::= digit [digits]

```

The number of digits between the `thousand-sep`s (maximum size of `digits`) is specified by the result of grouping().

The format of floating-point values is as follows:

```
floatval    ::= [sign] units [decimal-point [digits]] [e [sign] digits] |
                [sign]        decimal-point  digits   [e [sign] digits]
e           ::= 'e' | 'E'

```

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<locale>` | |
| std::numpunct<char> | provides equivalents of the "C" locale preferences |
| std::numpunct<wchar_t> | provides wide character equivalents of the "C" locale preferences |

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `char_type` | `CharT` |
| `string_type` | std::basic_string<CharT> |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member | Description |
| std::locale::id `id` [static] | the identifier of the facet |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a new `numpunct` facet   (public member function) |
| (destructor) | destructs a `numpunct` facet   (protected member function) |
| decimal_point | invokes `do_decimal_point`   (public member function) |
| thousands_sep | invokes `do_thousands_sep`   (public member function) |
| grouping | invokes `do_grouping`   (public member function) |
| truenamefalsename | invokes `do_truename` or `do_falsename`   (public member function) |

### Protected member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| do_decimal_point[virtual] | provides the character to use as decimal point   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_thousands_sep[virtual] | provides the character to use as thousands separator   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_grouping[virtual] | provides the numbers of digits between each pair of thousands separators   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_truenamedo_falsename[virtual] | provides the string to use as the name of the boolean true and false   (virtual protected member function) |

### Example

The following example changes the string representations of true and false:

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
struct french_bool : std::numpunct<char>
{
    string_type do_truename() const override { return "vrai"; }
    string_type do_falsename() const override { return "faux"; }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "default locale: "
              << std::boolalpha << true << ", " << false << '\n';
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale(std::cout.getloc(), new french_bool));
    std::cout << "locale with modified numpunct: "
              << std::boolalpha << true << ", " << false << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
default locale: true, false
locale with modified numpunct: vrai, faux

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 338 | C++98 | the `sign` token allowed an optional whitespace following `+` or `-` | removed the whitespace |
