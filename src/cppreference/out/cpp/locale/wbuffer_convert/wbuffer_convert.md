| wbuffer_convert::~wbuffer_convert | | | | |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bufptr` | `cvtptr` | `cvtstate` |
| (1) | nullptr | new Codecvt | state_type() |
| (2) | bytebuf | pcvt | state |

2) If pcvt is a null pointer, the behavior is undefined.3) The copy constructor is deleted, `wbuffer_convert` is not CopyConstructible.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bytebuf | - | pointer to the underlying buffer |
| pcvt | - | pointer to a standalone (not managed by a locale) facet |
| state | - | the initial value of the character conversion state |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <codecvt>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
    // Wrap a UTF-8 string stream in a UCS4 wbuffer_convert
    std::stringbuf utf8buf("z\u00df\u6c34\U0001f34c");
                       // or "\x7a\xc3\x9f\xe6\xb0\xb4\xf0\x9f\x8d\x8c"
                       // or u8"zß水🍌"
    std::wbuffer_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>> conv_in(&utf8buf);
    std::wistream ucsbuf(&conv_in);
    std::cout << "Reading from a UTF-8 stringbuf via wbuffer_convert: "
              << std::hex << std::showbase;
    for (wchar_t c; ucsbuf.get(c);)
        std::cout << static_cast<std::wint_t>(c) << ' ';
 
    // Wrap a UTF-8 aware std::cout in a UCS4 wbuffer_convert to output UCS4
    std::wbuffer_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>> conv_out(std::cout.rdbuf());
    std::wostream out(&conv_out);
    std::cout << "\nSending UCS4 data to std::cout via wbuffer_convert: ";
    out << L"z\u00df\u6c34\U0001f34c\n";
}

```

Output:

```
Reading from a UTF-8 stringbuf via wbuffer_convert: 0x7a 0xdf 0x6c34 0x1f34c 
Sending UCS4 data to std::cout via wbuffer_convert: zß水🍌

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2175 | C++11 | pcvt could be a null pointer | the behavior is undefined in this case |
| LWG 2176 | C++11 | constructors accepting single argument were implicit | made explicit |
| P0935R0 | C++11 | the default constructor was explicit | made implicit |
