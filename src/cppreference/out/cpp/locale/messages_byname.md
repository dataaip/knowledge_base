|  |  |  |

`std::messages_byname` is a std::messages facet which encapsulates retrieval of strings from message catalogs of the locale specified at its construction.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<locale>` | |
| std::messages_byname<char> | narrow/multibyte message catalog access |
| std::messages_byname<wchar_t> | wide string message catalog access |

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `catalog` | std::messages_base<CharT>::catalog |
| `string_type` | std::basic_string<CharT> |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ****(constructor)**** | constructs a new `messages_byname` facet   (public member function) |
| ****(destructor)**** | destroys a `messages_byname` facet   (protected member function) |

## std::messages_byname::messages_byname

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| explicit messages_byname( const char\* name, std::size_t refs = 0 ); |  |  |
| explicit messages_byname( const std::string& name, std::size_t refs = 0 ); |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Constructs a new `std::messages_byname` facet for a locale with name.

refs is used for resource management: if refs == 0, the implementation destroys the facet, when the last std::locale object holding it is destroyed. Otherwise, the object is not destroyed.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | - | the name of the locale |
| refs | - | the number of references that link to the facet |

## std::messages_byname::~messages_byname

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| protected:  ~messages_byname(); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Destroys the facet.

## Inherited from std::messages

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `char_type` | `CharT` |
| `string_type` | std::basic_string<CharT> |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member | Description |
| std::locale::id `id` [static] | the identifier of the facet |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| open | invokes `do_open`   (public member function of `std::messages<CharT>`) |
| get | invokes `do_get`   (public member function of `std::messages<CharT>`) |
| close | invokes `do_close`   (public member function of `std::messages<CharT>`) |

### Protected member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| do_open[virtual] | opens a named message catalog   (virtual protected member function of `std::messages<CharT>`) |
| do_get[virtual] | retrieves a message from an open message catalog   (virtual protected member function of `std::messages<CharT>`) |
| do_close[virtual] | closes a message catalog   (virtual protected member function of `std::messages<CharT>`) |

## Inherited from std::messages_base

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `catalog` | an unspecified signed integer type |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
void try_with(const std::locale& loc)
{
    const std::messages<char>& facet = std::use_facet<std::messages<char>>(loc);
 
    std::messages<char>::catalog cat = facet.open("sed", std::cout.getloc());
    if (cat < 0)
        std::cout << "Could not open \"sed\" message catalog\n";
    else
        std::cout << "\"No match\" "
                  << facet.get(cat, 0, 0, "No match") << '\n'
                  << "\"Memory exhausted\" " 
                  << facet.get(cat, 0, 0, "Memory exhausted") << '\n';
 
    facet.close(cat);
}
 
int main()
{
    std::locale loc("en_US.utf8");
    std::cout.imbue(loc);
 
    try_with(std::locale(loc, new std::messages_byname<char>("de_DE.utf8")));
    try_with(std::locale(loc, new std::messages_byname<char>("fr_FR.utf8")));
    try_with(std::locale(loc, new std::messages_byname<char>("ja_JP.utf8")));
}

```

Possible output:

```
"No match" Keine Übereinstimmung
"Memory exhausted" Speicher erschöpft
"No match" Pas de concordance
"Memory exhausted" Mémoire épuisée
"No match" 照合しません
"Memory exhausted" メモリーが足りません

```
