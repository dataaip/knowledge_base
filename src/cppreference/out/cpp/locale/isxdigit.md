| Defined in header `<locale>` |  |  |
| template< class CharT >  bool isxdigit( CharT ch, const locale& loc ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Checks if the given character is classified as a hexadecimal digit by the given locale's std::ctype facet.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ch | - | character |
| loc | - | locale |

### Return value

Returns true if the character is classified as a hexadecimal digit, false otherwise.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class CharT> bool isxdigit(CharT ch, const std::locale& loc) {     return std::use_facet<std::ctype<CharT>>(loc).is(std::ctype_base::xdigit, ch); } ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
 
struct gxdigit_ctype : std::ctype<wchar_t>
{
    std::unordered_set<wchar_t> greek_digits{L'α', L'β', L'γ', L'δ', L'ε', L'ζ'};
 
    bool do_is(mask m, char_type c) const override
    {
        return (m & xdigit) && greek_digits.contains(c)
            ? true // 6 first Greek small letters will be classified as digits
            : ctype::do_is(m, c); // leave the rest to the parent class
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::wstring text = L"0123456789abcdefABCDEFαβγδεζηθικλμ";
    std::locale loc(std::locale(""), new gxdigit_ctype);
 
    std::locale::global(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
    std::wcout.imbue(std::locale());
 
    std::wcout << "Hexadecimal digits in text: ";
    for (const wchar_t c : text)
        if (std::isxdigit(c, loc))
            std::wcout << c << L' ';
    std::wcout << L'\n';
 
    std::wcout << "Not hexadecimal digits in text: ";
    for (const wchar_t c : text)
        if (not std::isxdigit(c, loc))
            std::wcout << c << L' ';
    std::wcout << L'\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Hexadecimal digits in text: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f A B C D E F α β γ δ ε ζ
Not hexadecimal digits in text: η θ ι κ λ μ

```
