Class template `std::messages` is a standard locale facet that encapsulates retrieval of strings from message catalogs, such as the ones provided by GNU gettext or by POSIX `catgets`.

The source of the messages is implementation-defined.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<locale>` | |
| std::messages<char> | accesses narrow string message catalog |
| std::messages<wchar_t> | accesses wide string message catalog |

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `char_type` | `CharT` |
| `string_type` | std::basic_string<CharT> |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member | Description |
| std::locale::id `id` [static] | the identifier of the facet |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a new `messages` facet   (public member function) |
| (destructor) | destructs a `messages` facet   (protected member function) |
| open | invokes `do_open`   (public member function) |
| get | invokes `do_get`   (public member function) |
| close | invokes `do_close`   (public member function) |

### Protected member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| do_open[virtual] | opens a named message catalog   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_get[virtual] | retrieves a message from an open message catalog   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_close[virtual] | closes a message catalog   (virtual protected member function) |

## Inherited from std::messages_base

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `catalog` | an unspecified signed integer type |

### See also

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| messages_base | defines messages catalog type   (class) |
| messages_byname | represents the system-supplied ****std::messages**** for the named locale   (class template) |
