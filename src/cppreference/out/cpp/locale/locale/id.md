| Defined in header `<locale>` |  |  |
| class locale::id; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

The class `std::locale::id` provides implementation-specific identification of a locale facet. Each facet has a public static member named `id` of type `std::locale::id` and each std::locale object maintains a list of facets it implements, indexed by their `id`s.

Facets with the same `id` belong to the same facet category and replace each other when added to a locale object.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a new id   (public member function) |
| operator= | copy assignment operator is deleted   (public member function) |

### Example

The following example shows how to construct a minimal custom facet.

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
struct myfacet : std::locale::facet
{
    myfacet(std::size_t refs = 0) : facet(refs) {}
    static ::std::locale::id id;
};
 
std::locale::id myfacet::id;
 
int main()
{
    std::locale myloc(std::locale(), new myfacet);
    std::cout << "has_facet<myfacet>(myloc) returns " << std::boolalpha
              << std::has_facet<myfacet>(myloc) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
has_facet<myfacet>(myloc) returns true

```
