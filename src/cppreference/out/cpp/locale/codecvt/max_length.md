| Defined in header `<locale>` |  |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | (1) |  |
| public:  int max_length() const throw(); |  | (until C++11) |
| public:  int max_length() const noexcept; |  | (since C++11) |

1) Public member function, calls the member function `do_max_length` of the most derived class.2) Returns the maximum value that do_length(state, from, from_end, 1) can return for any valid range ``from`,`from_end`)` and any valid `state`.

### Return value

The maximum number of `ExternT` characters that could be consumed if converted by [in() to produce one `InternT` character.

The non-converting specialization std::codecvt<char, char, std::mbstate_t> returns 1.

### Notes

If the encoding is state-dependent (encoding() == -1), then more than `max_length()` external characters may be consumed to produce one internal character.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <codecvt>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "In codecvt_utf8, the longest multibyte character is "
              << std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>().max_length() << " bytes long\n";
 
    std::cout << "In header-consuming codecvt_utf8, the longest multibyte character is "
              << std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t,
                                   0x10ffff,
                                   std::consume_header>().max_length() << " bytes long\n";
 
    std::cout << "In this system's en_US.utf8, the longest multibyte character is "
              << std::use_facet<std::codecvt<wchar_t, char, std::mbstate_t>>(
                     std::locale("en_US.utf8")
                 ).max_length() << " bytes long\n";
 
    std::cout << "In this system's zh_CN.gb18030, the longest multibyte character is "
              << std::use_facet<std::codecvt<wchar_t, char, std::mbstate_t>>(
                     std::locale("zh_CN.gb18030")
                 ).max_length() << " bytes long\n";
}

```

Output:

```
In codecvt_utf8, the longest multibyte character is 4 bytes long
In header-consuming codecvt_utf8, the longest multibyte character is 7 bytes long
In this system's en_US.utf8, the longest multibyte character is 6 bytes long
In this system's zh_CN.gb18030, the longest multibyte character is 4 bytes long

```
