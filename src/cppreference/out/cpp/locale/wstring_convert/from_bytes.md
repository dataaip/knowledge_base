| wide_string from_bytes( const char\* ptr ); | (2) |  |

|  |  |  |

Converts a byte sequence to a wide string using the facet pointed to by `cvtptr` ﻿.

1) The byte sequence only consists of one element byte.2) The byte sequence is the null-terminated sequence beginning at ptr.3) The byte sequence is the sequence contained in str.4) The byte sequence is the range ``first`,`last`)`.

Before the conversion begins, if \*this was ****not**** constructed with constructor overload [(3), `cvtstate` will be set to its default value (the initial conversion state).

The number of input elements successfully converted will be stored in `cvtcount` ﻿.

### Return value

If the conversion succeeds, returns the conversion result. Otherwise, if \*this is constructed with constructor overload (4), returns `wide_err_string`.

### Exceptions

If the conversion fails and \*this was ****not**** constructed with constructor overload (4), throws std::range_error.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <codecvt>
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::string utf8 = "z\u00df\u6c34\U0001d10b"; // or u8"zß水𝄋"
                 // or "\x7a\xc3\x9f\xe6\xb0\xb4\xf0\x9d\x84\x8b";
 
    // the UTF-8 / UTF-16 standard conversion facet
    std::u16string utf16 = 
        std::wstring_convert<std::codecvt_utf8_utf16<char16_t>,
                             char16_t>{}.from_bytes(utf8.data());
    std::cout << "UTF-16 conversion produced " << utf16.size()
              << " code units: " << std::showbase;
    for (char16_t c : utf16)
        std::cout << std::hex << static_cast<std::uint16_t>(c) << ' ';
 
    // the UTF-8 / UTF-32 standard conversion facet
    std::u32string utf32 =
        std::wstring_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<char32_t>, char32_t>{}.from_bytes(utf8);
    std::cout << "\nUTF-32 conversion produced " << std::dec
              << utf32.size() << " code units: ";
    for (char32_t c : utf32)
        std::cout << std::hex << static_cast<std::uint32_t>(c) << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
UTF-16 conversion produced 5 code units: 0x7a 0xdf 0x6c34 0xd834 0xdd0b
UTF-32 conversion produced 4 code units: 0x7a 0xdf 0x6c34 0x1d10b

```
