| byte_string to_bytes( const Elem\* wptr ); | (2) |  |

|  |  |  |

Converts a wide sequence to a byte string using the facet pointed to by `cvtptr` ﻿.

1) The wide sequence only consists of one element byte.2) The wide sequence is the null-terminated sequence beginning at ptr.3) The wide sequence is the sequence contained in str.4) The wide sequence is the range ``first`,`last`)`.

Before the conversion begins, if \*this was ****not**** constructed with constructor overload [(3), `cvtstate` will be set to its default value (the initial conversion state).

The number of input elements successfully converted will be stored in `cvtcount` ﻿.

### Return value

If the conversion succeeds, returns the conversion result. Otherwise, if \*this is constructed with constructor overload (4), returns `byte_err_string`.

### Exceptions

If the conversion fails and \*this was ****not**** constructed with constructor overload (4), throws std::range_error.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <codecvt>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <string>
 
// utility function for output
void hex_print(const std::string& s)
{
    std::cout << std::hex << std::setfill('0');
    for (unsigned char c : s)
        std::cout << std::setw(2) << static_cast<int>(c) << ' ';
    std::cout << std::dec << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    // wide character data
    std::wstring wstr = L"z\u00df\u6c34\U0001f34c"; // or L"zß水🍌"
 
    // wide to UTF-8
    std::wstring_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>> conv1;
    std::string u8str = conv1.to_bytes(wstr);
    std::cout << "UTF-8 conversion produced " << u8str.size() << " bytes:\n";
    hex_print(u8str);
 
    // wide to UTF-16le
    std::wstring_convert<std::codecvt_utf16<wchar_t, 0x10ffff, std::little_endian>> conv2;
    std::string u16str = conv2.to_bytes(wstr);
    std::cout << "UTF-16le conversion produced " << u16str.size() << " bytes:\n";
    hex_print(u16str);
}

```

Output:

```
UTF-8 conversion produced 10 bytes:
7a c3 9f e6 b0 b4 f0 9f 8d 8c 
UTF-16le conversion produced 10 bytes:
7a 00 df 00 34 6c 3c d8 4c df

```
