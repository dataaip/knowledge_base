1) Obtain the **reference type** of a dereferenceable type `T`.2) Obtain the **rvalue reference type** of a dereferenceable type `T`, that is, the return type of ranges::iter_move.3) Compute a `Readable` type's **common reference type**. This is the common reference type of its reference type and an lvalue reference to its value type.

### Notes

The -> auto&& constraint checks that the type of the expression is not void.
