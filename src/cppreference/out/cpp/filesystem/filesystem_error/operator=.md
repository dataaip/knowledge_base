| filesystem_error& operator=( const filesystem_error& other ) noexcept; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Assigns the contents with those of other. If \*this and other both have dynamic type `std::filesystem::filesystem_error` then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | another `filesystem_error` object to assign with |

### Return value

\*this

### Notes

Typical implementations store `path` objects referenced by path1() and path2() in a reference-counted storage. As a result, \*this and other usually share their `path` objects after assignment.
