| template< std::sentinel_for<Iter> S >  friend constexpr bool     operator==( const move_iterator& i, const std::move_sentinel<S>& s ); |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Compares a `move_iterator` and a `move_sentinel`.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if i.base() == s.base() is well-formed and convertible to bool.

This function template is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::move_iterator<Iter> is an associated class of the arguments.

The `!=` operator is synthesized from `operator==`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| i | - | the move iterator to compare |
| s | - | the move sentinel to compare |

### Return value

i.base() == s.base()
