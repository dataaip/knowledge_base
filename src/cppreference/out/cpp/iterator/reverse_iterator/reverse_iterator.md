| template< class U >  reverse_iterator( const reverse_iterator<U>& other ); | (3) | (constexpr since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Constructs a new `reverse_iterator`.

| Overload | `current` |
| --- | --- |
| (1) | value-initialized |
| (2) | initialized with x |
| (3) | initialized with other.`current` |

3) The converting constructor.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_same_v<U, Iter> is false and std::convertible_to<const U&, Iter> is modeled. | (since C++20) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | - | iterator to adapt |
| other | - | iterator adaptor to copy |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <concepts>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::vector v{0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
 
    using ReverseIt = std::reverse_iterator<std::vector<int>::const_iterator>;
 
    ReverseIt i1; // overload (1)
    i1 = v.crbegin();
    assert(*i1 == 4);
 
    ReverseIt i2(i1); // overload (2)
    assert(i2[0] == 4);
 
    int x[]{1, 2, 3};
    auto i3 = std::reverse_iterator<int*>(x + std::size(x)); // overload (1)
    i3[0] = -3;
    assert(x[2] == -3);
    std::reverse_iterator<int const*> i4(i3); // overload (3): int => const int
    static_assert(std::convertible_to<decltype(i3)::value_type,
                                      decltype(i4)::value_type>);
    // i4[0] = 5; // Error: assignment of read-only location
}

```

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 235 | C++98 | the effect of overload (1) was not specified | specified |
| LWG 1012 | C++98 | overload (1) default-initialized `current` | it is value-initialized |
| LWG 3435 | C++20 | overload (3) was not constrained | constrained |
