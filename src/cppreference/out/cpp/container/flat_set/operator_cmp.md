|  |  |  |

Compares the contents of the underlying containers of two container adaptors. The comparison is done by applying the corresponding operator to the underlying containers.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | container adaptors whose contents to compare  |  |  | | --- | --- | |  | This section is incomplete Reason: Add named requirements to "flat" container inner types | |

### Return value

1) true if the corresponding comparison yields true, false otherwise.2) Result of three-way comparison on underlying containers.

### Complexity

1) Constant if lhs and rhs are of different size, otherwise linear in the size of the `flat_set`.2)
Linear in the size of the container.
