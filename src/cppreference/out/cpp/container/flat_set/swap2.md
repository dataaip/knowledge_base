| Defined in header `<flat_set>` |  |  |
| friend void swap( std::flat_set& lhs, std::flat_set& rhs ) noexcept; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Specializes the std::swap algorithm for std::flat_set. Swaps the contents of lhs and rhs. Calls lhs.swap(rhs).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | containers whose contents to swap |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Same as swapping the underlying containers.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <flat_set>
 
int main()
{
    std::flat_set<int> alice{1, 2, 3};
    std::flat_set<int> bob{7, 8, 9, 10};
 
    auto print = [](const int& n) { std::cout << ' ' << n; };
 
    // Print state before swap
    std::cout << "Alice:";
    std::for_each(alice.begin(), alice.end(), print);
    std::cout << "\nBobby:";
    std::for_each(bob.begin(), bob.end(), print);
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    std::cout << "-- SWAP\n";
    std::swap(alice, bob);
 
    // Print state after swap
    std::cout << "Alice:";
    std::for_each(alice.begin(), alice.end(), print);
    std::cout << "\nBobby:";
    std::for_each(bob.begin(), bob.end(), print);
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Alice: 1 2 3
Bobby: 7 8 9 10
-- SWAP
Alice: 7 8 9 10
Bobby: 1 2 3

```
