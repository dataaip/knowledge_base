| void shrink_to_fit(); |  | (constexpr since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Requests the removal of unused capacity.

It is a non-binding request to reduce capacity() to size(). It depends on the implementation whether the request is fulfilled.

If reallocation occurs, all iterators (including the `end()` iterator) and all references to the elements are invalidated. If no reallocation occurs, no iterators or references are invalidated.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| If `T` is not MoveInsertable into std::vector<T, Allocator>, the behavior is undefined. | (since C++11) |

### Complexity

At most linear in the size of the container.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Exceptions If an exception is thrown other than by the move constructor of a non-CopyInsertable `T`, there are no effects. | (since C++11) |

### Notes

In libstdc++, `shrink_to_fit()` is not available in C++98 mode.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v;
    std::cout << "Default-constructed capacity is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    v.resize(100);
    std::cout << "Capacity of a 100-element vector is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    v.resize(50);
    std::cout << "Capacity after resize(50) is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    v.shrink_to_fit();
    std::cout << "Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    v.clear();
    std::cout << "Capacity after clear() is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    v.shrink_to_fit();
    std::cout << "Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    for (int i = 1000; i < 1300; ++i)
        v.push_back(i);
    std::cout << "Capacity after adding 300 elements is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    v.shrink_to_fit();
    std::cout << "Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
Default-constructed capacity is 0
Capacity of a 100-element vector is 100
Capacity after resize(50) is 100
Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is 50
Capacity after clear() is 50
Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is 0
Capacity after adding 300 elements is 512
Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is 300

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 755 | C++98 | `std::vector` lacked explicit shrink-to-fit operations | provided |
| LWG 2033 | C++98 C++11 | 1. the complexity requirement was missing (C++98) 2. `T` was not required to be MoveInsertable (C++11) | 1. added 2. required |
| LWG 2223 | C++98 C++11 | 1. references, pointers, and iterators were not invalidated (C++98) 2. there was no exception safety guarantee (C++11) | 1. they may be invalidated 2. added |
