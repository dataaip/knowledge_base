| template< class OtherExtents >  friend constexpr bool operator==( const mapping& lhs, const mapping<OtherExtents>& rhs ) noexcept; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Compares two layout mappings of the same layout type based on their underlying extents.

Layout mappings lhs and rhs compare equal if both lhs.extents() and rhs.extents() are equal.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if extents_type::rank() == OtherExtents::rank() is true.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | layout mappings whose extents to compare |

### Return value

true if lhs.extents() == rhs.extents() is true, false otherwise
