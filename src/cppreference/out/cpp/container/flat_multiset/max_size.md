| size_type max_size() const noexcept; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the maximum number of elements the container is able to hold due to system or library implementation limitations, i.e. std::distance(begin(), end()) for the largest container.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Maximum number of elements.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

This value typically reflects the theoretical limit on the size of the container, at most std::numeric_limits<difference_type>::max(). At runtime, the size of the container may be limited to a value smaller than `max_size()` by the amount of RAM available.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <flat_set>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
    std::flat_multiset<char> q;
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
    std::cout << "Maximum size of a std::flat_multiset is " << q.max_size() << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
Maximum size of a std::flat_multiset is 768,614,336,404,564,650

```
