| template< class... Args >  constexpr reference unchecked_emplace_back( Args&&... args ); |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

Appends a new element to the end of the container. Typically, the element is constructed using placement-new to construct the element in-place at the location provided by the container. The arguments args... are forwarded to the constructor as std::forward<Args>(args)....
Equivalent to return \*try_emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...);.

Before the call to this function size() < capacity() must be true. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

No iterators or references are invalidated, except `end()`, which is invalidated if the insertion occurs.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| args | - | arguments to forward to the constructor of the element |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`T` must be EmplaceConstructible into `inplace_vector` from std::forward<Args>(args).... | | |

### Return value

`back()`, i.e. a reference to the inserted element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown by initialization of inserted element. If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Notes

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <inplace_vector>
#include <new>
#include <print>
#include <string>
#include <utility>
¬†
int main()
{
    std::inplace_vector<std::pair<std::string, std::string>, 2> fauna;
    std::string dog{"\N{DOG}"};
¬†
    fauna.unchecked_emplace_back("\N{CAT}", dog);
    fauna.unchecked_emplace_back("\N{CAT}", std::move(dog));
    std::println("fauna = {}", fauna);
¬†
    // fauna.unchecked_emplace_back("BUG", "BUG"); // undefined behavior: no space
}

```

Output:

```
fauna = [("üêà", "üêï"), ("üêà", "üêï")]

```
