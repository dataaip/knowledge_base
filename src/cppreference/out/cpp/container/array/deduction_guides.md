| ****Deduction guides**** (C++17) | | | | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<array>` |  |  |
| template< class T, class... U >  array( T, U... ) -> array<T, 1 + sizeof...(U)>; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

One deduction guide is provided for std::array to provide an equivalent of std::experimental::make_array for construction of `std::array` from a variadic parameter pack.

The program is ill-formed if (std::is_same_v<T, U> && ...) is not true. Note that (std::is_same_v<T, U> && ...) is true when sizeof...(U) is zero.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <cassert>
#include <type_traits>
 
int main()
{
    const int x = 10;
    std::array a{1, 2, 3, 5, x}; // OK, creates std::array<int, 5>
    assert(a.back() == x);
 
//  std::array b{1, 2u}; // Error, all arguments must have the same type
 
//  std::array<short> c{3, 2, 1}; // Error, wrong number of template args
    std::array c{std::to_array<short>({3, 2, 1})}; // C++20 facility
    assert(std::ranges::equal(c, std::array{3, 2, 1}));
    static_assert(std::is_same_v<short, decltype(c)::value_type>);
}

```
