1,2) Returns an iterator pointing to the first element that is **not less** than (i.e. greater or equal to) key.3,4) Returns an iterator pointing to the first element that compares **not less** (i.e. greater or equal) to the value x. This overload participates in overload resolution only if the qualified-id Compare::is_transparent is valid and denotes a type. It allows calling this function without constructing an instance of `Key`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| key | - | key value to compare the elements to |
| x | - | alternative value that can be compared to `Key` |

### Return value

Iterator pointing to the first element that is not **less** than key. If no such element is found, a past-the-end iterator (see end()) is returned.

### Complexity

Logarithmic in the size of the container.
