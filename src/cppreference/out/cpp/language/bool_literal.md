### Syntax

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| `true` | (1) |  |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| `false` | (2) |  |
|  | | | | | | | | | |

### Explanation

The Boolean literals are the keywords true and false. They are prvalues of type `bool`.

### Notes

See Integral conversions for implicit conversions from `bool` to other types and boolean conversions for the implicit conversions from other types to `bool`.

### Keywords

false,
true

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << std::boolalpha
              << true << '\n'
              << false << '\n'
              << std::noboolalpha
              << true << '\n'
              << false << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
true
false
1
0

```
