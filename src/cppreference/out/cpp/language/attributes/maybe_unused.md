Suppresses warnings on unused entities.

### Syntax

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| `[[maybe_unused]]` |  |  |
|  | | | | | | | | | |

### Explanation

This attribute can appear in the declaration of the following entities:

- class/struct/union: struct [[maybe_unused]] S;
- typedef, including those declared by alias declaration: [[maybe_unused]] typedef S\* PS;, using PS [[maybe_unused]] = S\*;
- variable, including static data member: [[maybe_unused]] int x;
- non-static data member: union U { [[maybe_unused]] int n; };,
- function: [[maybe_unused]] void f();
- enumeration: enum [[maybe_unused]] E {};
- enumerator: enum { A [[maybe_unused]], B [[maybe_unused]] = 42 };
- structured binding: [[maybe_unused]] auto [a, b] = std::make_pair(42, 0.23);

For entities declared [[maybe_unused]], if the entities or their structured bindings are unused, the warning on unused entities issued by the compiler is suppressed.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| For labels declared [[maybe_unused]], if they are unused, the warning on unused labels issued by the compiler is suppressed. | (since C++26) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
 
[[maybe_unused]] void f([[maybe_unused]] bool thing1,
                        [[maybe_unused]] bool thing2)
{
    [[maybe_unused]] lb: // the label “lb” is not used, no warning
    [[maybe_unused]] bool b = thing1 && thing2;
    assert(b); // in release mode, assert is compiled out, and “b” is unused
               // no warning because it is declared [[maybe_unused]]
} // parameters “thing1” and “thing2” are not used, no warning
 
int main() {}

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CWG 2360 | C++17 | could not apply [[maybe_unused]] to structured bindings | allowed |
