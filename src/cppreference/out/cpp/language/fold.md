Reduces (folds "enwiki:Fold (higher-order function)")) a pack over a binary operator.

### Syntax

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| `(` pack op `... )` | (1) |  |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| `( ...` op pack `)` | (2) |  |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| `(` pack op `...` op init `)` | (3) |  |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| `(` init op `...` op pack `)` | (4) |  |
|  | | | | | | | | | |

1) Unary right fold.2) Unary left fold.3) Binary right fold.4) Binary left fold.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| op | - | any of the following 32 **binary** operators: + - \* / % ^ & | = < > << >> += -= \*= /= %= ^= &= |= <<= >>= == != <= >= && || , .\* ->\*. In a binary fold, both ops must be the same. |
| pack | - | an expression that contains an unexpanded pack and does not contain an operator with precedence lower than cast at the top level (formally, a cast-expression) |
| init | - | an expression that does not contain an unexpanded pack and does not contain an operator with precedence lower than cast at the top level (formally, a cast-expression) |

Note that the opening and closing parentheses are a required part of the fold expression.

### Explanation

The instantiation of a **fold expression** expands the expression e as follows:

1) Unary right fold `(E` op `...)` becomes `(E1` op `(`... op `(EN-1` op `EN)))`2) Unary left fold `(...` op `E)` becomes `(((E1` op `E2)` op ...`)` op `EN)`3) Binary right fold `(E` op `...` op `I)` becomes `(E1` op `(`... op `(ENâˆ’1` op `(EN` op `I))))`4) Binary left fold `(I` op `...` op `E)` becomes `((((I` op `E1)` op `E2)` op ...`)` op `EN)`

(where `N` is the number of elements in the pack expansion)

For example,

```
template<typename... Args>
bool all(Args... args) { return (... && args); }
Â 
bool b = all(true, true, true, false);
// within all(), the unary left fold expands as
//  return ((true && true) && true) && false;
// b is false

```

When a unary fold is used with a pack expansion of length zero, only the following operators are allowed:

1) Logical AND (&&). The value for the empty pack is true.2) Logical OR (||). The value for the empty pack is false.3) The comma operator (,). The value for the empty pack is void().

### Notes

If the expression used as init or as pack has an operator with precedence below cast at the top level, it must be parenthesized:

```
template<typename... Args>
int sum(Args&&... args)
{
//  return (args + ... + 1 * 2);   // Error: operator with precedence below cast
    return (args + ... + (1 * 2)); // OK
}

```

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <climits>
#include <concepts>
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
#include <type_traits>
#include <utility>
#include <vector>
Â 
// Basic usage, folding variadic arguments over operator<< 
template<typename... Args>
void printer(Args&&... args)
{
    (std::cout << ... << args) << '\n';
}
Â 
// Folding an expression that uses the pack directly over operator,
template<typename... Ts>
void print_limits()
{
    ((std::cout << +std::numeric_limits<Ts>::max() << ' '), ...) << '\n';
}
Â 
// Both a fold over operator&& using the pack
// and over operator, using the variadic arguments
template<typename T, typename... Args>
void push_back_vec(std::vector<T>& v, Args&&... args)
{
    static_assert((std::is_constructible_v<T, Args&&> && ...));
    (v.push_back(std::forward<Args>(args)), ...);
}
Â 
// Using an integer sequence to execute an expression
// N times by folding a lambda over operator,
template<class T, std::size_t... dummy_pack>
constexpr T bswap_impl(T i, std::index_sequence<dummy_pack...>)
{
    T low_byte_mask = static_cast<unsigned char>(-1);
    T ret{};
    ([&]
    {
        (void)dummy_pack;
        ret <<= CHAR_BIT;
        ret |= i & low_byte_mask;
        i >>= CHAR_BIT;
    }(), ...);
    return ret;
}
Â 
constexpr auto bswap(std::unsigned_integral auto i)
{
    return bswap_impl(i, std::make_index_sequence<sizeof(i)>{});
}
Â 
int main()
{
    printer(1, 2, 3, "abc");
    print_limits<uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t>();
Â 
    std::vector<int> v;
    push_back_vec(v, 6, 2, 45, 12);
    push_back_vec(v, 1, 2, 9);
    for (int i : v)
        std::cout << i << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
Â 
    static_assert(bswap<std::uint16_t>(0x1234u) == 0x3412u);
    static_assert(bswap<std::uint64_t>(0x0123456789abcdefull) == 0xefcdab8967452301ULL);
}

```

Output:

```
123abc
255 65535 4294967295 
6 2 45 12 1 2 9

```
