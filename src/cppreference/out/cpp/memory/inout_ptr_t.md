|  |  |  |

`inout_ptr_t` is used to adapt types such as smart pointers for foreign functions that reset ownership via a `Pointer*` (usually `T**` for some object type `T`) or void\*\* parameter.

`inout_ptr_t` captures additional arguments on construction, provides a storage for the result which such an aforementioned foreign function accesses, releases the ownership held by the adapted `Smart` object, and finally resets the adapted `Smart` object with the result and the captured arguments when it is destroyed.

`inout_ptr_t` behaves as if it holds following non-static data members:

- a `Smart&` reference, which is bound to the adapted object on construction,
- for every `T` in `Args...`, a member of type `T`, which is an argument captured on construction and used for resetting while destruction, and
- a member subobject that suitable for storing a `Pointer` within it and providing a void\* object, where the `Pointer` or void\* object is generally exposed to a foreign function for ownership resetting.

If `Smart` is not a pointer type, release() is called at most once on the adapted object. Implementations may call release() within constructor, or before resetting within destructor if the `Pointer` value is not null.

Users can control whether each argument for resetting is captured by copy or by reference, by specifying an object type or a reference type in `Args...` respectively.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Smart | - | the type of the object (typically a smart pointer) to adapt |
| Pointer | - | type of the object (typically a raw pointer) to which a foreign function accesses for ownership resetting |
| Args... | - | type of captured arguments used for resetting the adapted object |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`Pointer` must meet the requirements of NullablePointer. | | |
| -The program is ill-formed if `Smart` is a std::shared_ptr specialization. | | |

### Specializations

Unlike most class templates in the standard library, program-defined specializations of `inout_ptr_t` that depend on at least one program-defined type need not meet the requirements for the primary template.

This license allows a program-defined specialization to expose the raw pointer stored within a non-standard smart pointer to foreign functions.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs an `inout_ptr_t`   (public member function) |
| operator=deleted | `inout_ptr_t` is not assignable   (public member function) |
| (destructor)(C++23) | resets the adapted smart pointer after releasing its ownership   (public member function) |
| operator Pointer\*operator void\*\*(C++23) | converts the `inout_ptr_t` to the address of the storage for output   (public member function) |

### Non-member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| inout_ptr(C++23) | creates an `inout_ptr_t` with an associated smart pointer and resetting arguments   (function template) |

### Notes

`inout_ptr_t` expects that the foreign functions release the ownership represented by the value of the pointed-to `Pointer`, and then re-initialize it. As such operation requires unique ownership, the usage with std::shared_ptr is forbidden.

The typical usage of `inout_ptr_t` is creating its temporary objects by std::inout_ptr, which resets the adapted smart pointer immediately. E.g. given a setter function and a smart pointer of appropriate type declared with int foreign_resetter(T\*\*); and std::unique_ptr<T, D> up; respectively,

```
if (int ec = foreign_resetter(std::inout_ptr(up)))
    return ec;

```

is roughly equivalent to

```
T *raw_p = up.get();
up.release();
int ec = foreign_resetter(&raw_p);
up.reset(raw_p);
if (ec != 0)
    return ec;

```

It is not recommended to create an `inout_ptr_t` object of a storage duration other than automatic storage duration, because such code is likely to produce dangling references and result in undefined behavior on destruction.

Captured arguments are typically packed into a std::tuple<Args...>. Implementations may use different mechanism to provide the `Pointer` or void\* object they need hold.
