Replaces the managed object.

1,2) Equivalent to auto old_ptr = get();  
/\* assigns “ptr” to the stored pointer \*/  
if (old_ptr)  
    get_deleter()(old_ptr);. If get_deleter()(old_ptr) throws an exception, the behavior is undefined.2) This overload participates in overload resolution only if `U` is the same type as `pointer`, or all following conditions are satisfied:

- `pointer` is the same type as `element_type*`.
- `U` is a pointer type `V*` such that `V(*)[]` is convertible to `element_type(*)[]`.
3) Equivalent to reset(pointer()).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ptr | - | pointer to a new object to manage |

### Notes

To replace the managed object while supplying a new deleter as well, move assignment operator may be used.

A test for self-reset, i.e. whether ptr points to an object already managed by \*this, is not performed, except where provided as a compiler extension or as a debugging assert. Note that code such as p.reset(p.release()) does not involve self-reset, only code like p.reset(p.get()) does.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
struct Foo // object to manage
{
    Foo() { std::cout << "Foo...\n"; }
    ~Foo() { std::cout << "~Foo...\n"; }
};
 
struct D // deleter
{
    void operator() (Foo* p)
    {
        std::cout << "Calling delete for Foo object... \n";
        delete p;
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Creating new Foo...\n";
    std::unique_ptr<Foo, D> up(new Foo(), D()); // up owns the Foo pointer (deleter D)
 
    std::cout << "Replace owned Foo with a new Foo...\n";
    up.reset(new Foo());  // calls deleter for the old one
 
    std::cout << "Release and delete the owned Foo...\n";
    up.reset(nullptr);      
}

```

Output:

```
Creating new Foo...
Foo...
Replace owned Foo with a new Foo...
Foo...
Calling delete for Foo object...
~Foo...
Release and delete the owned Foo...
Calling delete for Foo object...
~Foo...

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2118 | C++11 | `unique_ptr<T[]>::reset` rejected qualification conversions | accepts |
| LWG 2169 | C++11 | the overload `unique_ptr<T[]>::reset(pointer)` existed | removed the overload |
