std::allocator_traits

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Member types | | | | |
| Member functions | | | | |
| allocator_traits::allocate | | | | |
| allocator_traits::allocate_at_least(C++23) | | | | |
| allocator_traits::deallocate | | | | |
| ****allocator_traits::construct**** | | | | |

| allocator_traits::max_size | | | | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<memory>` |  |  |
| template< class T, class... Args >  static void construct( Alloc& a, T\* p, Args&&... args ); |  | (since C++11)  (constexpr since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

If possible, constructs an object of type `T` in allocated uninitialized storage pointed to by p, by calling
a.construct(p, std::forward<Args>(args)...).

If the above is not possible (e.g. `Alloc` does not have the member function `construct()`), then calls

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ::new (static_cast<void\*>(p)) T(std::forward<Args>(args)...) | (until C++20) |
| std::construct_at(p, std::forward<Args>(args)...) | (since C++20) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a | - | allocator to use for construction |
| p | - | pointer to the uninitialized storage on which a `T` object will be constructed |
| args... | - | the constructor arguments to pass to a.construct() or to placement-new(until C++20)std::construct_at()(since C++20) |

### Return value

(none)

### Notes

This function is used by the standard library containers when inserting, copying, or moving elements.

Because this function provides the automatic fall back to placement new, the member function `construct()` is an optional Allocator requirement since C++11.
