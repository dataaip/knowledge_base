| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<memory>` |  |  |
| template< class Ptr >  constexpr auto to_address( const Ptr& p ) noexcept; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| template< class T >  constexpr T\* to_address( T\* p ) noexcept; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Obtain the address represented by p without forming a reference to the object pointed to by p.

1) Fancy pointer overload: If the expression std::pointer_traits<Ptr>::to_address(p) is well-formed, returns the result of that expression. Otherwise, returns std::to_address(p.operator->()).2) Raw pointer overload: If `T` is a function type, the program is ill-formed. Otherwise, returns p unmodified.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p | - | fancy or raw pointer |

### Return value

Raw pointer that represents the same address as p does.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class T> constexpr T* to_address(T* p) noexcept {     static_assert(!std::is_function_v<T>);     return p; }   template<class T> constexpr auto to_address(const T& p) noexcept {     if constexpr (requires{ std::pointer_traits<T>::to_address(p); })         return std::pointer_traits<T>::to_address(p);     else         return std::to_address(p.operator->()); } ``` |

### Notes

`std::to_address` can be used even when p does not reference storage that has an object constructed in it, in which case std::addressof(\*p) cannot be used because there is no valid object for the parameter of std::addressof to bind to.

The fancy pointer overload of `std::to_address` inspects the std::pointer_traits<Ptr> specialization. If instantiating that specialization is itself ill-formed (typically because `element_type` cannot be defined), that results in a hard error outside the immediate context and renders the program ill-formed.

`std::to_address` may additionally be used on iterators that satisfy std::contiguous_iterator.

| `__cpp_lib_to_address` | `201711L` | (C++20) | Utility to convert a pointer to a raw pointer (`std::to_address`) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <memory>
 
template<class A>
auto allocator_new(A& a)
{
    auto p = a.allocate(1);
    try
    {
        std::allocator_traits<A>::construct(a, std::to_address(p));
    }
    catch (...)
    {
        a.deallocate(p, 1);
        throw;
    }
    return p;
}
 
template<class A>
void allocator_delete(A& a, typename std::allocator_traits<A>::pointer p)
{
    std::allocator_traits<A>::destroy(a, std::to_address(p));
    a.deallocate(p, 1);
}
 
int main()
{
    std::allocator<int> a;
    auto p = allocator_new(a);
    allocator_delete(a, p);
}

```
