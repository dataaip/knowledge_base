1) Copies value to an uninitialized memory area ``first`,`last`)` as if by

for (; first != last; ++first)  
::new ([**voidify**(\*first)) std::remove_reference_t<std::iter_reference_t<I>>(value);  
return first;

 If an exception is thrown during the initialization, the objects already constructed are destroyed in an unspecified order.2) Equivalent to return ranges::uninitialized_fill(ranges::begin(r), ranges::end(r), value);.

The function-like entities described on this page are **algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | iterator-sentinel pair denoting the range of elements to initialize |
| r | - | the range of the elements to initialize |
| value | - | the value to construct the elements with |

### Return value

As described above.

### Complexity

Linear in the size of the uninitialized memory area.

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown on construction of the elements in the destination range.

### Notes

An implementation may improve the efficiency of the `ranges::uninitialized_fill`, e.g. by using ranges::fill, if the value type of the output range is TrivialType.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text struct uninitialized_fill_fn {     template<no-throw-forward-iterator I, no-throw-sentinel-for<I> S, class T>         requires std::constructible_from<std::iter_value_t<I>, const T&>     constexpr I operator()(I first, S last, const T& value) const     {         I rollback{first};         try         {             for (; !(first == last); ++first)                 ranges::construct_at(std::addressof(*first), value);             return first;         }         catch (...)         {                // rollback: destroy constructed elements             for (; rollback != first; ++rollback)                 ranges::destroy_at(std::addressof(*rollback));             throw;         }     } Â      template<no-throw-forward-range R, class T>         requires std::constructible_from<ranges::range_value_t<R>, const T&>     constexpr ranges::borrowed_iterator_t<R> operator()(R&& r, const T& value) const     {         return (*this)(ranges::begin(r), ranges::end(r), value);     } }; Â  inline constexpr uninitialized_fill_fn uninitialized_fill{}; ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
Â 
int main()
{
    constexpr int n{4};
    alignas(alignof(std::string)) char out[n * sizeof(std::string)];
Â 
    try
    {
        auto first{reinterpret_cast<std::string*>(out)};
        auto last{first + n};
        std::ranges::uninitialized_fill(first, last, "â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€");
Â 
        int count{1};
        for (auto it{first}; it != last; ++it)
            std::cout << count++ << ' ' << *it << '\n';
Â 
        std::ranges::destroy(first, last);
    }
    catch(...)
    {
        std::cout << "Exception!\n";
    }
}

```

Output:

```
1 â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€
2 â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€
3 â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€
4 â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€

```
