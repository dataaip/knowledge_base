| Defined in header `<memory>` |  |  |
| Call signature |  |  |
| template< no-throw-forward-iterator I, no-throw-sentinel-for<I> S >  Â  Â  requires std::default_initializable<std::iter_value_t<I>> I uninitialized_default_construct( I first, S last ); | (1) | (since C++20)  (constexpr since C++26) |

|  |  |  |

1) Constructs objects of type std::iter_value_t<I> in the uninitialized memory area ``first`,`last`)` by [default-initialization, as if by

for (; first != last; ++first)  
::new (**voidify**(\*first))  
std::remove_reference_t<std::iter_reference_t<I>>;  
return first;

 If an exception is thrown during the initialization, the objects already constructed are destroyed in an unspecified order.2) Equivalent to ranges::uninitialized_default_construct(ranges::begin(r), ranges::end(r)).

The function-like entities described on this page are **algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | iterator-sentinel pair denoting the range of the elements to initialize |
| r | - | the range of the elements to initialize |

### Return value

As described above.

### Complexity

Linear in the distance between first and last.

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown on construction of the elements in the destination range.

### Notes

An implementation may skip the objects construction (without changing the observable effect) if no non-trivial default constructor is called while default-initializing a std::iter_value_t<I> object, which can be detected by std::is_trivially_default_constructible.

### Possible implementation

| ```text struct uninitialized_default_construct_fn {     template<no-throw-forward-iterator I, no-throw-sentinel-for<I> S>         requires std::default_initializable<std::iter_value_t<I>>     constexpr I operator()(I first, S last) const     {         using ValueType = std::remove_reference_t<std::iter_reference_t<I>>;         if constexpr (std::is_trivially_default_constructible_v<ValueType>)             return ranges::next(first, last); // skip initialization         I rollback{first};         try         {             for (; !(first == last); ++first)                 ::new (static_cast<void*>(std::addressof(*first))) ValueType;             return first;         }         catch (...) // rollback: destroy constructed elements         {             for (; rollback != first; ++rollback)                 ranges::destroy_at(std::addressof(*rollback));             throw;         }     } Â      template<no-throw-forward-range R>         requires std::default_initializable<ranges::range_value_t<R>>     constexpr ranges::borrowed_iterator_t<R> operator()(R&& r) const     {         return (*this)(ranges::begin(r), ranges::end(r));     } }; Â  inline constexpr uninitialized_default_construct_fn uninitialized_default_construct{}; ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
Â 
int main()
{
    struct S { std::string m{"â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€"}; };
Â 
    constexpr int n{4};
    alignas(alignof(S)) char out[n * sizeof(S)];
Â 
    try
    {
        auto first{reinterpret_cast<S*>(out)};
        auto last{first + n};
Â 
        std::ranges::uninitialized_default_construct(first, last);
Â 
        auto count{1};
        for (auto it{first}; it != last; ++it)
            std::cout << count++ << ' ' << it->m << '\n';
Â 
        std::ranges::destroy(first, last);
    }
    catch (...) { std::cout << "Exception!\n"; }
Â 
    // Notice that for "trivial types" the uninitialized_default_construct
    // generally does not zero-fill the given uninitialized memory area.
    constexpr char sample[]{'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', '\n'};
    char v[]{'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', '\n'};
    std::ranges::uninitialized_default_construct(std::begin(v), std::end(v));
    if (std::memcmp(v, sample, sizeof(v)) == 0)
    {
        std::cout << "  ";
        // Maybe undefined behavior, pending CWG 1997 to be resolved:
        // for (const char cÂ : v) { std::cout << c << ' '; }
        for (const char c : sample)
            std::cout << c << ' ';
    }
    else
        std::cout << "Unspecified\n";
}

```

Possible output:

```
1 â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€
2 â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€
3 â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€
4 â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€
  A B C D

```
