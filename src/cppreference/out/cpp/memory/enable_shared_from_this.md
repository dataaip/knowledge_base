| Defined in header `<memory>` |  |  |
| template< class T >  class enable_shared_from_this; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

`std::enable_shared_from_this` allows an object t that is currently managed by a std::shared_ptr named pt to safely generate additional std::shared_ptr instances pt1, pt2 etc. that all share ownership of t with pt.

Publicly inheriting from `std::enable_shared_from_this<T>` provides the type `T` with a member function `shared_from_this`. If an object t of type `T` is managed by a std::shared_ptr<T> named pt, then calling `T::shared_from_this` will return a new std::shared_ptr<T> that shares ownership of t with pt.

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member | Description |
| mutable std::weak_ptr<T> `weak_this` | the object tracking the control block of the first shared owner of \*this (exposition-only member object\*) |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs an `enable_shared_from_this` object   (protected member function) |
| (destructor) | destroys an `enable_shared_from_this` object   (protected member function) |
| operator= | returns a reference to \*this   (protected member function) |
| shared_from_this | returns a std::shared_ptr which shares ownership of \*this   (public member function) |
| weak_from_this(C++17) | returns a std::weak_ptr which shares ownership of \*this   (public member function) |

### Notes

The constructors of std::shared_ptr detect the presence of an unambiguous and accessible (i.e. public inheritance is mandatory) `enable_shared_from_this` base and assign the newly created std::shared_ptr to `weak_this` if not already owned by a live std::shared_ptr. Constructing a std::shared_ptr for an object that is already managed by another std::shared_ptr will not consult `weak_this` and thus will lead to undefined behavior.

It is permitted to call `shared_from_this` only on a previously shared object, i.e. on an object managed by std::shared_ptr<T>. Otherwise, std::bad_weak_ptr is thrown (by the std::shared_ptr constructor from a default-constructed `weak_this`â€Šï»¿).

`enable_shared_from_this` provides the safe alternative to an expression like std::shared_ptr<T>(this), which is likely to result in this being destructed more than once by multiple owners that are unaware of each other (see example below).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
Â 
class Good : public std::enable_shared_from_this<Good>
{
public:
    std::shared_ptr<Good> getptr()
    {
        return shared_from_this();
    }
};
Â 
class Best : public std::enable_shared_from_this<Best>
{
    struct Private{ explicit Private() = default; };
Â 
public:
    // Constructor is only usable by this class
    Best(Private) {}
Â 
    // Everyone else has to use this factory function
    // Hence all Best objects will be contained in shared_ptr
    static std::shared_ptr<Best> create()
    {
        return std::make_shared<Best>(Private());
    }
Â 
    std::shared_ptr<Best> getptr()
    {
        return shared_from_this();
    }
};
Â 
struct Bad
{
    std::shared_ptr<Bad> getptr()
    {
        return std::shared_ptr<Bad>(this);
    }
    ~Bad() { std::cout << "Bad::~Bad() called\n"; }
};
Â 
void testGood()
{
    // Good: the two shared_ptr's share the same object
    std::shared_ptr<Good> good0 = std::make_shared<Good>();
    std::shared_ptr<Good> good1 = good0->getptr();
    std::cout << "good1.use_count() = " << good1.use_count() << '\n';
}
Â 
void misuseGood()
{
    // Bad: shared_from_this is called without having std::shared_ptr owning the caller
    try
    {
        Good not_so_good;
        std::shared_ptr<Good> gp1 = not_so_good.getptr();
    }
    catch (std::bad_weak_ptr& e)
    {
        // undefined behavior (until C++17) and std::bad_weak_ptr thrown (since C++17)
        std::cout << e.what() << '\n';
    }
}
Â 
void testBest()
{
    // Best: Same but cannot stack-allocate it:
    std::shared_ptr<Best> best0 = Best::create();
    std::shared_ptr<Best> best1 = best0->getptr();
    std::cout << "best1.use_count() = " << best1.use_count() << '\n';
Â 
    // Best stackBest; // <- Will not compile because Best::Best() is private.
}
Â 
void testBad()
{
    // Bad, each shared_ptr thinks it is the only owner of the object
    std::shared_ptr<Bad> bad0 = std::make_shared<Bad>();
    std::shared_ptr<Bad> bad1 = bad0->getptr();
    std::cout << "bad1.use_count() = " << bad1.use_count() << '\n';
} // UB: double-delete of Bad
Â 
int main()
{
    testGood();
    misuseGood();
Â 
    testBest();
Â 
    testBad();
}

```

Possible output:

```
good1.use_count() = 2
bad_weak_ptr
best1.use_count() = 2
bad1.use_count() = 1
Bad::~Bad() called
Bad::~Bad() called
*** glibc detected *** ./test: double free or corruption

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2179 (P0033R1) | C++11 | given type `T` derived from `enable_shared_from_this`, the behavior of constructing two std::shared_ptr<T>s from the same T\* object was unclear | the behavior is undefined in this case |
| LWG 2529 (P0033R1) | C++11 | it was unclear how the underlying std::weak_ptr is updated | made clear |
