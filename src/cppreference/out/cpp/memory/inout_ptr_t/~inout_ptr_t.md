Resets the adapted `Smart` object by the value of modified `Pointer` object (or the void\* object if operator void\*\*() has been called) and the captured arguments. release() may be called on the adapted `Smart` object if it is not called by the constructor.

Let

- `s` denotes the adapted `Smart` object,
- `args...` denotes the captured arguments,
- `p` denotes the value of stored `Pointer`, or static_cast<Pointer>(\*operator void\*\*()) if operator void\*\* has been called,
- `SP` be
  - Smart::pointer, if it is valid and denotes a type, otherwise,
  - Smart::element_type\*, if Smart::element_type is valid and denotes a type, otherwise,
  - std::pointer_traits<Smart>::element_type\*, if std::pointer_traits<Smart>::element_type is valid and denotes a type, otherwise,
  - `Pointer`,
- /\*do-release\*/ denotes s.release() if the constructor does not call release(), empty otherwise.

If `Smart` is a pointer type, the destructor performs

:   s = static_cast<Smart>(p);, and the program is ill-formed if sizeof...(Args) > 0;

otherwise, if s.reset(static_cast<SP>(p), std::forward<Args>(args)...) is well-formed, the destructor performs

:   /\*do-release\*/; if (p) { s.reset(static_cast<SP>(p), std::forward<Args>(args)...); };

otherwise, if std::is_constructible_v<Smart, SP, Args...> is true, the destructor performs

:   /\*do-release\*/; if (p) { s = Smart(static_cast<SP>(p), std::forward<Args>(args)...); };

otherwise, the program is ill-formed.

### Notes

The implementation may allocate the storage for the data structure needed for `Smart` (e.g. a control block) on construction, in order to leave non-throwing works to the destructor.

Arguments captured by value are destroyed after resetting.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3897 | C++23 | the destructor did not update a raw pointer to the null value | it does |
