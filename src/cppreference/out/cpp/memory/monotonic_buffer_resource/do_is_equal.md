Compare \*this with other for identity - memory allocated using a `monotonic_buffer_resource` can only be deallocated using that same resource.

### Return value

this == &other

### Defect report

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3000 | C++17 | unnecessary `dynamic_cast` was performed | removed |
