Replaces the managed object with the one managed by r.

If \*this already owns an object and it is the last `shared_ptr` owning it, and r is not the same as \*this, the object is destroyed through the owned deleter.

1,2) Shares ownership of the object managed by r. If r manages no object, \*this manages no object too. Equivalent to shared_ptr<T>(r).swap(\*this).3,4) Move-assigns a `shared_ptr` from r. After the assignment, \*this contains a copy of the previous state of r, and r is empty. Equivalent to shared_ptr<T>(std::move(r)).swap(\*this).5) Transfers the ownership of the object managed by r to \*this. If r manages no object, \*this manages no object too. After the assignment, \*this contains the pointer previously held by r, and use_count() == 1; also r is empty. Equivalent to shared_ptr<T>(r).swap(\*this).6) Transfers the ownership of the object managed by r to \*this. The deleter associated to r is stored for future deletion of the managed object. r manages no object after the call. Equivalent to shared_ptr<T>(std::move(r)).swap(\*this).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| r | - | another smart pointer to share the ownership to or acquire the ownership from |

### Return value

\*this

### Notes

The implementation may meet the requirements without creating a temporary `shared_ptr` object.

### Exceptions

5,6) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
