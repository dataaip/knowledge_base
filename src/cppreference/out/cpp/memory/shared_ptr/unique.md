| bool unique() const noexcept; |  | (deprecated in C++17)  (removed in C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Checks if \*this is the only `shared_ptr` instance managing the current object, i.e. whether use_count() == 1.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if \*this is the only `shared_ptr` instance managing the current object, false otherwise.

### Notes

This function was deprecated in C++17 and removed in C++20 because use_count() == 1 is meaningless in multithreaded environment (see Notes in use_count).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream> 
#include <memory> 
 
int main() 
{ 
    auto sp1 = std::make_shared<int>(5);
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << "sp1.unique() == " << sp1.unique() << '\n'; 
 
    std::shared_ptr<int> sp2 = sp1; 
    std::cout << "sp1.unique() == " << sp1.unique() << '\n'; 
}

```

Output:

```
sp1.unique() == true
sp1.unique() == false

```
