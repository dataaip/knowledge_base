| static std::size_t length( const char_type\* p ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Calculates the length of a null-terminated character sequence, that is, the smallest `i` such that p[i] == 0.

Standard library specializations of std::regex_traits execute std::char_traits<CharT>::length(p);.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p | - | pointer to the first element of the null-terminated character sequence |

### Return value

The length of the null-terminated character string.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <regex>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << std::regex_traits<char>::length("Кошка") << '\n'
              << std::regex_traits<wchar_t>::length(L"Кошка") << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
10
5

```
