| difference_type position( size_type n = 0 ) const; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the position of the first character of the specified sub-match.

If n == 0, the position of the first character of the entire matched expression is returned.

If n > 0 && n < size(), the position of the first character of the nth sub-match is returned.

if n >= size(), a position of the first character of the unmatched match is returned.

`ready()` must be true. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | - | integral number specifying which match to examine |

### Return value

The position of the first character of the specified match or sub-match.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <regex>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::regex re("a(a)*b");
    std::string target("aaab");
    std::smatch sm;
 
    std::regex_match(target, sm, re);
    std::cout << sm.position(1) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
2

```
