| bool ready() const; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Indicates if the match results are ready (valid) or not.

A default-constructed match result has no result state (is not **ready**), and can only be made ready by one of the regex algorithms. The **ready** state implies that all match results have been fully established.

The result of calling most member functions of the `match_results` object that is not **ready** is undefined.

### Return value

true if the match results are ready, false otherwise.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <regex>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::string target("big-red-cat");
    std::smatch sm;
    std::cout << "Default constructed smatch is "
              << (sm.ready() ? "ready.\n" : "not ready.\n");
 
    std::regex re1(".*-red-.*");
    std::regex_search(target, sm, re1);
 
    std::cout << "After search, smatch is "
              << (sm.ready() ? "ready.\n" : "not ready.\n");
}

```

Output:

```
Default constructed smatch is not ready.
After search, smatch is ready.

```
