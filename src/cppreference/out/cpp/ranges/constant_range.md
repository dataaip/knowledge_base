| template< class T >  concept constant_range =      ranges::input_range<T> && /\*constant-iterator\*/<ranges::iterator_t<T>>; | (1) | (since C++23) |

|  |  |  |

1) The `constant_range` concept is a refinement of `range` for which `ranges::begin` returns a constant iterator.2) The concept /\*constant-iterator\*/<T> is satisfied when the result of the indirection operation of the input iterator is its const reference type which implies read-only.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <ranges>
#include <span>
#include <string_view>
#include <vector>
 
// mechanisms for ensuring the parameter is a constant range
// 1) an overload set where the mutable one defers to the constant one
template<std::ranges::constant_range R>
void takes_any_range1(R&& r)
{
    // R is definitely a constant range
}
 
template<std::ranges::range R>
void takes_any_range1(R&& r)
{
    takes_any_range1(std::views::as_const(std::forward<R>(r)));
}
 
// 2) one function template that shadows its parameter
template<std::ranges::range R>
void takes_any_range2(R&& _r)
{
    auto r = std::views::as_const(std::forward<R>(_r));
 
    // r is definitely a constant range
    // never use _r again
}
 
// 3) one function template that recursively invokes itself
template<std::ranges::range R>
void takes_any_range3(R&& r)
{
    if constexpr (std::ranges::constant_range<R>)
    {
        // R is definitely a constant range
        // put implementation here
    }
    else
        takes_any_range3(std::views::as_const(std::forward<R>(r)));
}
 
static_assert
(
        std::ranges::constant_range<const std::vector<int>> and
    not std::ranges::constant_range<std::vector<int>> and
        std::ranges::constant_range<std::string_view> and
    not std::ranges::constant_range<std::span<int>> and
        std::ranges::constant_range<std::span<const int>> and
    not std::ranges::constant_range<const std::span<int>>
);
 
int main() {}
