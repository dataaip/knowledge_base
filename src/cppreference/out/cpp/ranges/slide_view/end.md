Returns a sentinel or an iterator representing the end of the `slide_view`.

1) Let `base_` and `n_` be the underlying data members. Equivalent to:

- If V models `slide-caches-nothing`, return iterator<false>(ranges::begin(base_) + ranges::range_difference_t<V>(size()), n_);.
- Otherwise, if V models `slide-caches-last`, return iterator<false>(ranges::prev(ranges::end(base_), n_ - 1, ranges::begin(base_)), n_);.
- Otherwise, if V models `common_range`, return iterator<false>(ranges::end(base_), ranges::end(base_), n_);.
- Otherwise, return sentinel(ranges::end(base_));.
 If V models `slide-caches-last`, this function caches the result within the `cached_end_` for use on subsequent calls. This is necessary to provide the amortized constant-time complexity required by the `range`.2) Equivalent to begin() + ranges::range_difference_t<const V>(size()).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A sentinel or an iterator representing the end of the `slide_view`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
    static constexpr auto source = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'};
 
    for (const auto subrange: source | std::views::slide(3))
    {
        std::cout << "[ ";
        for (auto it = subrange.begin(); it != subrange.end(); ++it)
            std::cout << *it << ' ';
        std::cout << "]\n";
    }
}

```

Output:

```
[ A B C ]
[ B C D ]

```
