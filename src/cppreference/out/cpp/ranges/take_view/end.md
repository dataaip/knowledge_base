| constexpr auto end() requires (!/\*simple-view\*/<V>); | (1) | (since C++20) |
| constexpr auto end() const requires ranges::range<const V>; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Returns a sentinel or an iterator representing the end of the `take_view`. The end of the `take_view` is either one past the `count`th element in the underlying range, or the end of the underlying range if the latter has less than `count` elements.

1) Returns a take_view::/\*sentinel\*/<false>, a std::default_sentinel_t, or a ranges::iterator_t<V>.2) Returns a take_view::/\*sentinel\*/<true>, a std::default_sentinel_t, or a ranges::iterator_t<const V>.

Overload (1) does not participate in overload resolution if `V` is a simple view (that is, if `V` and `const V` are views with the same iterator and sentinel types).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The result depends on the concepts satisfied by possibly const-qualified underlying view type `Base`, that is `V` for (1) or `const V` for (2).

Let `base_` be the underlying view.

| The underlying view type satisfies ... | | `random_access_range` | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| yes | no |
| `sized_range` | yes | ranges::begin(base_) +     ranges::range_difference_t<Base_>(this->size()) | std::default_sentinel |
| no | 1) /\*sentinel\*/<false>{ranges::end(base_)}2) /\*sentinel\*/<true>{ranges::end(base_)} | |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <list>
#include <ranges>
#include <type_traits>
namespace ranges = std::ranges;
namespace views = std::views;
 
int main()
{
    const auto list1 = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5};
    const auto seq1{list1 | views::take(4)};
    static_assert(ranges::sized_range<decltype(seq1)> and
                  ranges::random_access_range<decltype(seq1)> and
                  std::is_same_v<decltype(seq1.end()), decltype(list1.end())>);
    for (auto it = seq1.begin(); it != seq1.end(); ++it)
        std::cout << *it << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    std::list list2{2, 7, 1, 8, 2};
    const auto seq2{list2 | views::take(4)};
    static_assert(ranges::sized_range<decltype(seq2)> and
                  not ranges::random_access_range<decltype(seq2)> and
                  std::is_same_v<decltype(seq2.end()), std::default_sentinel_t>);
    for (auto it = seq2.begin(); it != std::default_sentinel; ++it)
        std::cout << *it << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
3 1 4 1
2 7 1 8

```
