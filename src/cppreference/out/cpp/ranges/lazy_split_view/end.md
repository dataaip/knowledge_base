| constexpr auto end() requires ranges::forward_range<V> && ranges::common_range<V>; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| constexpr auto end() const; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Returns an iterator or sometimes a sentinel representing the end of the `view`. Let `base_` be the underlying view.

1) Returns an iterator. Equivalent to:
return /\*outer_iterator\*/</\*simple_view\*/<V>>{\*this, ranges::end(base_)};.2) Returns an `outer_iterator` or a std::default_sentinel.

Equivalent to:

```
if constexpr (ranges::forward_range<V> && ranges::forward_range<const V> &&
              ranges::common_range<const V>)
    return /*outer_iterator*/<true>{*this, ranges::end(base_)};
else
    return std::default_sentinel;

```

### Return value

An `outer_iterator` or a std::default_sentinel representing the end of the `view`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr std::string_view keywords{"false float for friend"};
    std::ranges::lazy_split_view kw{keywords, ' '};
    const auto count = std::ranges::distance(kw.begin(), kw.end());
    std::cout << "Words count: " << count << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Words count: 4

```
