|  |  |  |

The partial specializations of std::tuple_element for std::ranges::subrange provide compile-time access to the iterator or sentinel type of a `subrange`, using tuple-like syntax. They are provided for structured binding support.

1,2) Obtains the iterator type, i.e. `I`.3,4) Obtains the sentinel type, i.e. `S`.

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member type | Definition |
| `type` | (1,2) `I` (3,4) `S` |

### Notes

As `get` functions for `subrange` return iterators and sentinels by value, const qualifier is not added to the result types when the `subrange` is const-qualified (but not volatile-qualified).

If the `subrange` is volatile-qualified, the result types are also volatile-qualified because the partial specialization for volatile or const volatile types are used. Such usage is deprecated.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iterator>
#include <list>
#include <ranges>
#include <type_traits>
 
int main()
{
    std::list<int> list{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6};
 
    std::ranges::subrange subrange
    {
        std::counted_iterator{std::begin(list), 4},
        std::default_sentinel
    };
 
    static_assert(
        std::is_same_v<
            std::tuple_element_t<0, decltype(subrange)>,
            // implementation-defined type:
            std::counted_iterator<std::_List_iterator<int>>
            >);
 
    static_assert(
        std::is_same_v<
            std::tuple_element_t<1, decltype(subrange)>,
            std::default_sentinel_t
            >);
}

```
