| friend constexpr void iter_swap( const /\*iterator\*/& x, const /\*iterator\*/& y )      noexcept( /\* see description \*/ ) requires ( /\* see description \*/ ); |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

Swaps the objects pointed to by the underlying iterators of x and y. Equivalent to 
std::visit  
(  
&  
{  
if constexpr (std::is_same_v<decltype(it1), decltype(it2)>)  
ranges::iter_swap(it1, it2);  
else  
ranges::swap(\*x, \*y);  
},  
x.`it_` ﻿,  
y.`it_`  
);

The expression in the requires clause is equivalent to 
std::swappable_with<std::iter_reference_t</\*iterator\*/>,  
std::iter_reference_t</\*iterator\*/>> &&  
(... && std::indirectly_swappable<ranges::iterator_t<`maybe-const` ﻿<Const, Views>>>)
.

If x.`it_` ﻿.valueless_by_exception() || y.`it_` ﻿.valueless_by_exception() is true, the behavior is undefined.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when concat_view::`iterator` ﻿<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x, y | - | iterators |

### Exceptions

Let its be a pack of lvalues, where each value is of the corresponding type in const ranges::iterator_t<`maybe-const` ﻿<Const, Views>>.

noexcept specification:noexcept(noexcept(ranges::swap(\*x, \*y)) && ... && noexcept(ranges::iter_swap(its, its)))
