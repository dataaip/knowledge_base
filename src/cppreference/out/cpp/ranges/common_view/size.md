| constexpr auto size() requires ranges::sized_range<V>; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| constexpr auto size() const requires ranges::sized_range<const V>; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the number of elements.

Equivalent to return ranges::size(base_);, where `base_` is the underlying view.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The number of elements.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr static auto v1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    constexpr auto common1 { v1 | std::views::common };
    static_assert(common1.size() == 5);
 
    constexpr auto take3 { v1 | std::views::reverse | std::views::take(3) };
    constexpr auto common2 { take3 | std::views::common };
    static_assert(common2.size() == 3);
 
    using namespace std::literals;
    constexpr static auto v2 = { "∧"sv, "∨"sv, "∃"sv, "∀"sv };
    static_assert(std::ranges::views::common(v2).size() == 4);
}

```
