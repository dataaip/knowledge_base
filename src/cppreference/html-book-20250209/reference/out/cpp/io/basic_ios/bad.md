Returns true if non-recoverable error has occurred on the associated stream. Specifically, returns true if badbit is set in rdstate().

See ios_base::iostate for the list of conditions that set `badbit`.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if a non-recoverable error has occurred, false otherwise.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstdlib>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::ifstream file("test.txt");
    if (!file) // operator! is used here
    {  
        std::cout << "File opening failed\n";
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
 
    // typical C++ I/O loop uses the return value of the I/O function
    // as the loop controlling condition, operator bool() is used here
    for (int n; file >> n;)
       std::cout << n << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    if (file.bad())
        std::cout << "I/O error while reading\n";
    else if (file.eof())
        std::cout << "End of file reached successfully\n";
    else if (file.fail())
        std::cout << "Non-integer data encountered\n";
}

```
