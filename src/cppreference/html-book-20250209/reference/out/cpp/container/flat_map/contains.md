1) Checks if there is an element with key equivalent to key in the container.2) Checks if there is an element with key that compares **equivalent** to the value x. This overload participates in overload resolution only if the qualified-id Compare::is_transparent is valid and denotes a type. It allows calling this function without constructing an instance of `Key`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| key | - | key value of the element to search for |
| x | - | a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key |

### Return value

true if there is such an element, otherwise false.

### Complexity

Logarithmic in the size of the container.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <flat_map>
 
int main()
{
    std::flat_map<int, char> example{{1, 'a'}, {2, 'b'}};
 
    for (int x : {2, 5})
        if (example.contains(x))
            std::cout << x << ": Found\n";
        else
            std::cout << x << ": Not found\n";
}

```

Output:

```
2: Found
5: Not found

```
