Removes specified elements from the container. The order of the remaining equivalent elements is preserved.

1,2) Removes the element at pos.3) Removes the elements in the range ``first`,`last`)`, which must be a valid range in \*this.4) Removes all elements with the key equivalent to key.5) Removes all elements with key that compares **equivalent** to the value x. This overload participates in overload resolution only if the qualified-id Compare::is_transparent is valid and denotes a type, and neither `iterator` nor `const_iterator` is implicitly convertible from `K`. It allows calling this function without constructing an instance of `Key`.

|  | Information on iterator invalidation is copied from [here |

The iterator pos must be valid and dereferenceable. Thus the end() iterator (which is valid, but is not dereferenceable) cannot be used as a value for pos.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | - | iterator to the element to remove |
| first, last | - | range of elements to remove |
| key | - | key value of the elements to remove |
| x | - | a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key denoting the elements to remove |

### Return value

1-3) Iterator following the last removed element.4) Number of elements removed.5) Number of elements removed.

### Exceptions

1-3) Throws nothing.4,5) Any exceptions thrown by the `Compare` object.

### Complexity

Depends on underlying container. Typically linear.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <flat_set>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::flat_multiset<int> c = {1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4};
 
    auto print = [&c]
    {
        std::cout << "c = { ";
        for (int n : c)
            std::cout << n << ' ';
        std::cout << "}\n";
    };
    print();
 
    std::cout << "Erase all odd numbers:\n";
    for (auto it = c.begin(); it != c.end();)
    {
        if (*it % 2 != 0)
            it = c.erase(it);
        else
            ++it;
    }
    print();
 
    std::cout << "Erase 1, erased count: " << c.erase(1) << '\n';
    std::cout << "Erase 2, erased count: " << c.erase(2) << '\n';
    std::cout << "Erase 2, erased count: " << c.erase(2) << '\n';
    print();
}

```

Output:

```
c = { 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 }
Erase all odd numbers:
c = { 2 2 4 4 }
Erase 1, erased count: 0
Erase 2, erased count: 2
Erase 2, erased count: 0
c = { 4 4 }

```
