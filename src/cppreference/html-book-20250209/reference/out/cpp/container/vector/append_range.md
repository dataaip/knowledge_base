| template< container-compatible-range<T> R >  constexpr void append_range( R&& rg ); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Inserts copies of elements from the range rg before `end()`, in non-reversing order.

If after the operation the new `size()` is greater than old `capacity()` a reallocation takes place, in which case all iterators (including the `end()` iterator) and all references to the elements are invalidated. Otherwise only the `end()` iterator is invalidated.

Each iterator in rg is dereferenced exactly once.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rg | - | a container compatible range, that is, an `input_range` whose elements are convertible to `T` |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`T` must be EmplaceConstructible into `vector` from \*ranges::begin(rg). Also, `T` must be MoveInsertable into `vector`. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined. | | |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

If reallocation happens, linear in the number of elements of the resulting `vector`; otherwise, linear in the number of elements inserted plus the distance to the `end()`.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown other than by the copy constructor, move constructor, assignment operator, or move assignment operator of `T` or by any `InputIterator` operation there are no effects. If an exception is thrown while inserting a single element at the end and `T` is CopyInsertable or std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v`<T>` is true, there are no effects. Otherwise, if an exception is thrown by the move constructor of a non-CopyInsertable `T`, the effects are unspecified.

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_containers_ranges` | `202202L` | (C++23) | Ranges-aware construction and insertion |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
 
int main()
{
    auto head = std::vector{1, 2, 3, 4};
    const auto tail = std::list{-5, -6, -7};
#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
    head.append_range(tail);
#else
    head.insert(head.end(), tail.cbegin(), tail.cend());
#endif
    assert((head == std::vector{1, 2, 3, 4, -5, -6, -7}));
}

```
