| constexpr size_type max_size() const noexcept; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the maximum number of elements the container is able to hold.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Maximum number of elements, i.e. `N`.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

Because each std::array<T, N> is a fixed-size container, the value returned by `max_size` equals `N` (which is also the value returned by size()).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <array>
 
int main()
{
    std::array<char, 10> p;
    std::array<long, 10> q;
 
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
    std::cout << std::uppercase
              << "p.max_size() = " << std::dec << p.max_size() << " = 0x"
              << std::hex << p.max_size() << '\n'
              << "q.max_size() = " << std::dec << q.max_size() << " = 0x"
              << std::hex << q.max_size() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
p.max_size() = 10 = 0xA
q.max_size() = 10 = 0xA

```
