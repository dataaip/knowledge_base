| tuple_element<std::array> | | | | |
| Deduction guides (C++17) | | | | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<array>` |  |  |
| template< class T, std::size_t N >  struct tuple_size< std::array<T, N> > :      std::integral_constant<std::size_t, N> { }; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Provides access to the number of elements in an std::array as a compile-time constant expression.

### Helper variable template

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template< class T >  constexpr std::size_t tuple_size_v = tuple_size<T>::value; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| value[static] | `N`, the number of elements in the array   (public static member constant) |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator std::size_t | converts the object to std::size_t, returns value   (public member function) |
| operator()(C++14) | returns value   (public member function) |

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `value_type` | std::size_t |
| `type` | std::integral_constant<std::size_t, value> |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <array>
 
int main()
{
    auto arr = std::to_array("ABBA");
    static_assert(std::tuple_size<decltype(arr)>{} == 5);
}

```
