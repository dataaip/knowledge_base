| constexpr reference push_back( const T& value ); | (1) | (since C++26) |
| constexpr reference push_back( T&& value ); | (2) | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

Appends the given element value to the end of the container.

1) The new element is initialized as a copy of value.2) value is moved into the new element.

No iterators or references are invalidated, except `end()`, which is invalidated if the insertion occurs.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | - | the value of the element to append |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`T` must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload (1). | | |
| -`T` must meet the requirements of MoveInsertable in order to use overload (2). | | |

### Return value

`back()`, i.e. a reference to the inserted element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

- std::bad_alloc if size() == capacity() before invocation.
- Any exception thrown by initialization of inserted element.

If an exception is thrown for any reason, these functions have no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <inplace_vector>
#include <new>
#include <print>
#include <string>
¬†
int main()
{
    std::inplace_vector<std::string, 2> fauna;
    std::string dog{"\N{DOG}"};
¬†
    fauna.push_back("\N{CAT}"); // overload (1)
    fauna.push_back(std::move(dog)); // overload (2)
    std::println("fauna = {}", fauna);
¬†
    try
    {
        fauna.push_back("\N{BUG}"); // throws: there is no space
    }
    catch(const std::bad_alloc& ex)
    {
        std::println("{}", ex.what());
    }
    std::println("fauna = {}", fauna);
}

```

Possible output:

```
fauna = ["üêà", "üêï"]
std::bad_alloc
fauna = ["üêà", "üêï"]

```
