| Defined in header `<stacktrace>` |  |  |
| std::ostream& operator<<( std::ostream& os, const std::stacktrace_entry& f ); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Inserts the description of f into the output stream os. Equivalent to return os << std::to_string(f);.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| os | - | an output stream |
| f | - | a `stacktrace_entry` whose description is to be inserted |

### Return value

os

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <stacktrace>
 
int main()
{
    for (const auto& f : std::stacktrace::current())
        std::cout << f << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
0x0000000000402AA7 in ./prog.exe
__libc_start_main in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
0x00000000004029B9 in ./prog.exe

```
