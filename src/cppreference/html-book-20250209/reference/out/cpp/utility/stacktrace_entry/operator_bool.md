Checks whether the `stacktrace_entry` is non-empty, i.e. it represents an evaluation in a stacktrace.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the `stacktrace_entry` is non-empty, false otherwise.

### Notes

A non-empty `stacktrace_entry` can be obtained from a std::basic_stacktrace created by std::basic_stacktrace::current or a copy of such `std::basic_stacktrace`.

An empty `stacktrace_entry` can be created by the default constructor.
