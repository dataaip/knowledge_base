Returns a past-the-end iterator. Equivalent to return begin() + has_value();.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Past-the-end iterator

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_optional_range_support` | `202406L` | (C++26) | Range support for `std::optional` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <optional>
#include <print>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr std::optional<int> none = std::nullopt; // optional @1
    constexpr std::optional<int> some = 42;           // optional @2
 
    static_assert(none.begin() == none.end());
    static_assert(some.begin() != some.end());
 
    // ranged-for loop support
    for (int i : none)
        std::println("Optional @1 has a value of {}", i);
 
    for (int i : some)
        std::println("Optional @2 has a value of {}", i);
}

```

Output:

```
Optional @2 has a value of 42

```
