| Defined in header `<utility>` |  |  |
| template< class R, class T >  constexpr bool in_range( T t ) noexcept; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Returns true if the value of t is in the range of values that can be represented in `R`, that is, if t can be converted to `R` in a value-preserving manner.

It is a compile-time error if either `T` or `U` is a non-integer type, a character type, or bool.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| t | - | value to test |

### Return value

true if the value of t is representable in `R`, false otherwise.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class R, class T> constexpr bool in_range(T t) noexcept {     return std::cmp_greater_equal(t, std::numeric_limits<R>::min()) &&         std::cmp_less_equal(t, std::numeric_limits<R>::max()); } ``` |

### Notes

This function cannot be used with enums (including std::byte), char, char8_t, char16_t, char32_t, wchar_t and bool.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_integer_comparison_functions` | `202002L` | (C++20) | Integer comparison functions |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
 
    std::cout << std::in_range<std::size_t>(-1) << '\n';
    std::cout << std::in_range<std::size_t>(42) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
false
true

```
