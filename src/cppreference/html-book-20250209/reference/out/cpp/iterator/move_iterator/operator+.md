| template< class Iter >   move_iterator<Iter> operator+      ( typename move_iterator<Iter>::difference_type n, const move_iterator<Iter>& it ); |  | (since C++11)  (constexpr since C++17)  (until C++20) |
| template< class Iter >   constexpr move_iterator<Iter> operator+ ( std::iter_difference_t<Iter> n, const move_iterator<Iter>& it ); |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the iterator it incremented by n.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| This overload participates in overload resolution only if it.base() + n is well-formed and has type `Iter`. | (since C++20) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | - | the number of positions to increment the iterator |
| it | - | the iterator adaptor to increment |

### Return value

it + n
