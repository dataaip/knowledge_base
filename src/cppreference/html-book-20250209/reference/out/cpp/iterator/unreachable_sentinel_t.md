| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<iterator>` |  |  |
| struct unreachable_sentinel_t; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| inline constexpr unreachable_sentinel_t unreachable_sentinel{}; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

1) `unreachable_sentinel_t` is an empty class type that can be used to denote the “upper bound” of an unbounded interval.2) `unreachable_sentinel` is a constant of type `unreachable_sentinel_t`.

### Non-member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ****operator==****(C++20) | compares an `unreachable_sentinel_t` with a value of any `weakly_incrementable` type   (function template) |

## operator==(std::unreachable_sentinel_t)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template<std::weakly_incrementable I>  friend constexpr bool operator==( unreachable_sentinel_t, const I& ) noexcept { return false; } |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

`unreachable_sentinel_t` can be compared with any `weakly_incrementable` type and the result is always false.

This function template is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when `std::unreachable_sentinel_t` is an associated class of the arguments.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
 
template<class CharT>
constexpr std::size_t strlen(const CharT* s)
{
    return std::ranges::find(s, std::unreachable_sentinel, CharT{}) - s;
}
 
template<class CharT>
constexpr std::size_t find_first(const CharT* haystack, const CharT* needle)
{
    const char* needle_end = needle + strlen(needle);
    // search(begin, unreachable_sentinel) is usually more efficient than
    // search(begin, end) due to one less comparison per cycle.
    // But "needle" MUST BE PRESENT in the "haystack", otherwise the call
    // is UB (which is a compile-time error in constexpr context).
    auto found = std::ranges::search(haystack, std::unreachable_sentinel,
                                     needle, needle_end);
    return found.begin() - haystack;
}
 
int main()
{
    static_assert(strlen("The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.") == 42);
    static_assert(find_first("unsigned short int", "short") == 9);
//  static_assert(find_first("long int", "float")); // compile-time error
}

```
