| #define NULL /\* implementation-defined \*/ |  |  |
|  |  |  |

The macro `NULL` is an implementation-defined null pointer constant.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text #define NULL 0 // since C++11 #define NULL nullptr ``` |

### Notes

In C, the macro `NULL` may have the type void\*, but that is not allowed in C++ because null pointer constants cannot have that type.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>
#include <typeinfo>
 
class S;
 
int main()
{
    int* p = NULL;
    int* p2 = static_cast<std::nullptr_t>(NULL);
    void(*f)(int) = NULL;
    int S::*mp = NULL;
    void(S::*mfp)(int) = NULL;
    auto nullvar = NULL; // may trigger a warning when compiling with gcc/clang
 
    std::cout << "The type of nullvar is " << typeid(nullvar).name() << '\n';
 
    if constexpr(std::is_same_v<decltype(NULL), std::nullptr_t>)
        std::cout << "NULL implemented with type std::nullptr_t\n";
    else
        std::cout << "NULL implemented using an integral type\n";
 
    [](...){}(p, p2, f, mp, mfp); // < suppresses "unused variable" warnings
}

```

Possible output:

```
The type of nullvar is long
NULL implemented using an integral type

```
