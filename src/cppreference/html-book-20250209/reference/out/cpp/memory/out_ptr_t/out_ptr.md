std::out_ptr_t

| Member functions | | | | |
| out_ptr_t::out_ptr_t | | | | |

| Defined in header `<memory>` |  |  |
| template< class Pointer = void, class Smart, class... Args >  auto out_ptr( Smart& s, Args&&... args ); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Returns an std::out_ptr_t with deduced template arguments that captures arguments for resetting by reference.

The program is ill-formed if construction of the return value (see below) is ill-formed.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| s | - | the object (typically a smart pointer) to adapt |
| args... | - | the arguments for resetting to capture |

### Return value

std::out_ptr_t<Smart, P, Args&&>(s, std::forward<Args>(args)...), where `P` is

- `Pointer`, if `Pointer` is not same as void. Otherwise,
- Smart::pointer, if it is valid and denotes a type. Otherwise,
- Smart::element_type\*, if Smart::element_type is valid and denotes a type. Otherwise,
- std::pointer_traits<Smart>::element_type\*.

### Notes

Users may specify the template argument for the template parameter `Pointer`, in order to interoperate with foreign functions that take a Pointer\*.

As all arguments for resetting are captured by reference, the returned `out_ptr_t` should be a temporary object destroyed at the end of the full-expression containing the call to the foreign function, in order to avoid dangling references.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_out_ptr` | `202106L` | (C++23) | `std::out_ptr`, std::inout_ptr |
| `202311L` | (C++26) | freestanding `std::out_ptr` and std::inout_ptr |

### Example

Use `std::out_ptr` to adapt a smart pointer for `sqlite3_open`, which expects a `sqlite3**` as an out parameter.

Run this code

```
#include <memory>
#include <sqlite3.h>
 
int main()
{
    auto close_db = [](sqlite3* db) { sqlite3_close(db); };
 
    {
        // open an in-memory database, and manage its lifetime with std::unique_ptr
        std::unique_ptr<sqlite3, decltype(close_db)> up;
        sqlite3_open(":memory:", std::out_ptr(up));
 
        sqlite3* db = up.get();
        // do something with db ...
    }
    {
        // same as above, but use a std::shared_ptr
        std::shared_ptr<sqlite3> sp;
        sqlite3_open(":memory:", std::out_ptr(sp, close_db));
 
        sqlite3* db = sp.get();
        // do something with db ...
    }
}

```
