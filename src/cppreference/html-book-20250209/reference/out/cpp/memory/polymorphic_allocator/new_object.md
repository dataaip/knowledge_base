| template< class U, class... CtorArgs >  U\* new_object( CtorArgs&&... ctor_args ); |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Allocates and constructs an object of type `U`.

Given `alloc` is a std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<T>:

```
U* p = alloc.new_object<U>(std::forward<CtorArgs>(ctor_args)...);

```

is equivalent to

```
U* p = alloc.allocate_object<U>();
try
{
    alloc.construct(p, std::forward<CtorArgs>(ctor_args)...);
}
catch (...)
{
    alloc.deallocate_object(p);
    throw;
}

```

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ctor_args | - | the arguments to forward to the constructor of `U` |

### Return value

A pointer to the allocated and constructed object.

### Notes

This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<>, but it may be useful in any specialization as a shortcut to avoid having to rebind from std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<T> to std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<U>, and having to call allocate, construct, and deallocate individually.

Since `U` is not deduced, it must be provided as a template argument when calling this function.

### Exceptions

May throw any exceptions thrown by the call to allocate_object or the constructor of `U`.
