| std::size_t owner_hash() const noexcept; |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

Returns an unspecified value such that for any object `other` where owner_equal(other) is true, owner_hash() == other.owner_hash() is true.

This hashing is used to make shared and weak pointers usable as keys in unordered associative containers, typically through std::owner_hash.

### Return value

A value that is identical for any `std::shared_ptr` or `std::weak_ptr` object sharing the same ownership.
