Checks whether the second range matches the suffix of the first range.

1) Let N1 be ranges::distance(first1, last1) and N2 be ranges::distance(first2, last2):

- If N1 < N2 is true, returns false.
- Otherwise, returns ranges::equal(std::move(first1) + (N1 - N2), last1,  
                std::move(first2), last2, pred, proj1, proj2).
2) Let N1 be ranges::distance(r1) and N2 be ranges::distance(r2).

- If N1 < N2 is true, returns false.
- Otherwise, returns ranges::equal(views::drop(ranges::ref_view(r1),  
                            N1 - static_cast<decltype(N1)>(N2)),  
                r2, pred, proj1, proj2).

The function-like entities described on this page are **algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first1, last1 | - | the range of elements to examine |
| r1 | - | the range of elements to examine |
| first2, last2 | - | the range of elements to be used as the suffix |
| r2 | - | the range of elements to be used as the suffix |
| pred | - | the binary predicate that compares the projected elements |
| proj1 | - | the projection to apply to the elements of the range to examine |
| proj2 | - | the projection to apply to the elements of the range to be used as the suffix |

### Return value

true if the second range matches the suffix of the first range, false otherwise.

### Complexity

Generally linear: at most \(\scriptsize \min(N1,N2) \)min(N1,N2) applications of the predicate and both projections. The predicate and both projections are not applied if N1 < N2 is true.

If both N1 and N2 can be calculated in constant time (i.e. both iterator-sentinel type pairs model `sized_sentinel_for`, or both range types model `sized_range`) and N1 < N2 is true, the time complexity is constant.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 4105 | C++23 | overload (2) calculated the size difference by N1 - N2[[1]](ends_with.html#cite_note-1) | changed to N1 - static_cast<decltype(N1)>(N2) |

1. ↑ Its result might be of an integer-class type, in this case ranges::drop_view cannot be constructed.
