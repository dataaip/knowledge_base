| template< class T >  concept regular = std::semiregular<T> && std::equality_comparable<T>; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The `regular` concept specifies that a type is **regular**, that is, it is copyable, default constructible, and equality comparable. It is satisfied by types that behave similarly to built-in types like int, and that are comparable with `==`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <concepts>
#include <iostream>
 
template<std::regular T>
struct Single
{
    T value;
    friend bool operator==(const Single&, const Single&) = default;
};
 
int main()
{
    Single<int> myInt1{4};
    Single<int> myInt2;
    myInt2 = myInt1;
 
    if (myInt1 == myInt2)
        std::cout << "Equal\n";
 
    std::cout << myInt1.value << ' ' << myInt2.value << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Equal
4 4

```
