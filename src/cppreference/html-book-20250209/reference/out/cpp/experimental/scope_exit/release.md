Makes the `scope_exit` inactive.

Once a `scope_exit` is inactive, it cannot become active again, and will not call its exit function on destruction.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Notes

`release` may be either manually called or automatically called by `scope_exit`'s move constructor.

| (constructor) | constructs a new `scope_exit`   (public member function) |
| (destructor) | calls the exit function when the scope is exited if the `scope_exit` is active, then destroys the `scope_exit`   (public member function) |
