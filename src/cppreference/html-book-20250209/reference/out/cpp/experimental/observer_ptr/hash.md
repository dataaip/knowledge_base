| Defined in header `<experimental/memory>` |  |  |
| template< class T > struct hash<std::experimental::observer_ptr<T>>; |  | (library fundamentals TS v2) |
|  |  |  |

The template specialization of std::hash for std::experimental::observer_ptr<T> allows users to obtain hashes of objects of type std::experimental::observer_ptr<T>.

For a given std::experimental::observer_ptr<T> p, this specialization ensures that std::hash<std::experimental::observer_ptr<T>>()(p) == std::hash<T\*>()(p.get()).
