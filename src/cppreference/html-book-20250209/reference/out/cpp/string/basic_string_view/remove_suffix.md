| constexpr void remove_suffix( size_type n ); |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Moves the end of the view back by n characters.

The behavior is undefined if n > size().

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | - | number of characters to remove from the end of the view |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
 
int main()
{
    char arr[] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', '\0', '\0', '\0'};
    std::string_view v(arr, sizeof arr);
    auto trim_pos = v.find('\0');
    if (trim_pos != v.npos)
        v.remove_suffix(v.size() - trim_pos);
    std::cout << "Array: '" << arr << "', size=" << sizeof arr << '\n'
              << "View : '" << v << "', size=" << v.size() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Array: 'abcd', size=7
View : 'abcd', size=4

```
