| size_type copy( CharT\* dest, size_type count, size_type pos = 0 ) const; |  | (since C++17)  (constexpr since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Copies the substring ``pos`,`pos + rcount`)` to the character array pointed to by dest, where `rcount` is the smaller of count and size() - pos.

Equivalent to Traits::copy(dest, data() + pos, rcount).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dest | - | pointer to the destination character string |
| count | - | requested substring length |
| pos | - | position of the first character |

### Return value

Number of characters copied.

### Exceptions

[std::out_of_range if pos > size().

### Complexity

Linear in `rcount`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <array>
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string_view>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr std::basic_string_view<char> source{"ABCDEF"};
    std::array<char, 8> dest;
    std::size_t count{}, pos{};
 
    dest.fill('\0');
    source.copy(dest.data(), count = 4); // pos = 0
    std::cout << dest.data() << '\n'; // ABCD
 
    dest.fill('\0');
    source.copy(dest.data(), count = 4, pos = 1);
    std::cout << dest.data() << '\n'; // BCDE
 
    dest.fill('\0');
    source.copy(dest.data(), count = 42, pos = 2); // ok, count -> 4
    std::cout << dest.data() << '\n'; // CDEF
 
    try
    {
        source.copy(dest.data(), count = 1, pos = 666); // throws: pos > size()
    }
    catch (std::out_of_range const& ex)
    {
        std::cout << ex.what() << '\n';
    }
}

```

Output:

```
ABCD
BCDE
CDEF
basic_string_view::copy: __pos (which is 666) > __size (which is 6)

```
