| constexpr void swap( basic_string_view& v ) noexcept; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Exchanges the view with that of v.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v | - | view to swap with |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
 
int main() 
{
    std::string_view a = "AAA";
    std::string_view b = "BBBB";
 
    std::cout << "Before swap:\n"
                 "a = " << a << "\n"
                 "b = " << b << "\n\n";
 
    a.swap(b);
 
    std::cout << "After swap:\n"
                 "a = " << a << "\n"
                 "b = " << b << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Before swap:
a = AAA
b = BBBB
 
After swap:
a = BBBB
b = AAA

```
