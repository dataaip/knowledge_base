| constexpr basic_string_view substr( size_type pos = 0,                                      size_type count = npos ) const; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Returns a view of the substring ``pos`,`pos + rlen`)`, where `rlen` is the smaller of count and size() - pos.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | - | position of the first character |
| count | - | requested length |

### Return value

View of the substring `[`pos`,`pos + rlen`)`.

### Exceptions

[std::out_of_range if pos > size().

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string_view>
 
int main()
{
    typedef std::size_t count_t, pos_t;
 
    constexpr std::string_view data{"ABCDEF"};
 
    std::cout << data.substr() << '\n'; // ABCDEF, i.e. data[0, 5] that is [0, 6)
    std::cout << data.substr(pos_t(1)) << '\n'; // BCDEF, i.e. [1, 6)
    std::cout << data.substr(pos_t(2), count_t(3)) << '\n'; // CDE, i.e. [2, 2 + 3)
    std::cout << data.substr(pos_t(4), count_t(42)) << '\n'; // EF, i.e. [4, 6)
 
    try
    {
        [[maybe_unused]]
        auto sub = data.substr(pos_t(666), count_t(1)); // throws: pos > size()
    }
    catch (std::out_of_range const& ex)
    {
        std::cout << ex.what() << '\n';
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
ABCDEF
BCDEF
CDE
EF
basic_string_view::substr: __pos (which is 666) > __size (which is 6)

```
