| Defined in header `<cwchar>` |  |  |
| std::size_t wcslen( const wchar_t\* str ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns the length of a wide string, that is the number of non-null wide characters that precede the terminating null wide character.

The behavior is undefined if there is no null character in the wide character array pointed to by str.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| str | - | pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be examined |

### Return value

The length of the null-terminated wide string str.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text std::size_t wcslen(const wchar_t* start) {     // NB: start is not checked for nullptr!     const wchar_t* end = start;     while (*end != L'\0')         ++end;     return end - start; } ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <cwchar>
int main()
{
    const wchar_t* str = L"Hello, world!";
    std::wcout << "The length of L\"" << str << "\" is " << std::wcslen(str) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
The length of L"Hello, world!" is 13

```
