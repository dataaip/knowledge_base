| Defined in header `<cstring>` |  |  |
| char\* strncat( char\* dest, const char\* src, std::size_t count ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Appends a byte string pointed to by src to a byte string pointed to by dest. At most count characters are copied. The resulting byte string is null-terminated.

The destination byte string must have enough space for the contents of both dest and src plus the terminating null character, except that the size of src is limited to count.

The behavior is undefined if the strings overlap.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dest | - | pointer to the null-terminated byte string to append to |
| src | - | pointer to the null-terminated byte string to copy from |
| count | - | maximum number of characters to copy |

### Return value

dest

### Notes

Because `std::strncat` needs to seek to the end of dest on each call, it is inefficient to concatenate many strings into one using `std::strncat`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
 
int main() 
{
    char str[50] = "Hello ";
    const char str2[50] = "World!";
    std::strcat(str, str2);
    std::strncat(str, " Goodbye World!", 3); // may issue "truncated output" warning
    std::puts(str);
}

```

Output:

```
Hello World! Go

```
