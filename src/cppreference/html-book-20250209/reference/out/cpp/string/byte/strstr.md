| Defined in header `<cstring>` |  |  |
| const char\* strstr( const char\* haystack, const char\* needle ); |  |  |
| char\* strstr(       char\* haystack, const char\* needle ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Finds the first occurrence of the byte string needle in the byte string pointed to by haystack. The terminating null characters are not compared.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| haystack | - | pointer to the null-terminated byte string to examine |
| needle | - | pointer to the null-terminated byte string to search for |

### Return value

Pointer to the first character of the found substring in haystack, or a null pointer if no such character is found. If needle points to an empty string, haystack is returned.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstring>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    const char* str = "Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.";
    const char* target = "not";
 
    for (const char* result = str; (result = std::strstr(result, target)); ++result)
        std::cout << "Found " << std::quoted(target)
                  << " starting at (" << result - str << "): "
                  << std::quoted(result) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Found "not" starting at (4): "not. Do, or do not. There is no try."
Found "not" starting at (19): "not. There is no try."

```
