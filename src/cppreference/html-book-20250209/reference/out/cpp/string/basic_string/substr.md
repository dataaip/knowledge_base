| --- | --- | --- |
|  | (1) |  |
| basic_string substr( size_type pos = 0, size_type count = npos ) const; |  | (until C++23)  (constexpr since C++20) |
| constexpr basic_string      substr( size_type pos = 0, size_type count = npos ) const&; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| constexpr basic_string substr( size_type pos = 0, size_type count = npos ) &&; | (2) | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Returns a substring ``pos`,`pos + count`)`. If the requested substring extends past the end of the string, i.e. the count is greater than size() - pos (e.g. if count == npos), the returned substring is `[`pos`,`[`size()``)`.

1) Equivalent to return basic_string(\*this, pos, count);.2) Equivalent to return basic_string(std::move(\*this), pos, count);.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | - | position of the first character to include |
| count | - | length of the substring |

### Return value

String containing the substring ``pos`,`pos + count`)` or `[`pos`,`[`size()``)`.

### Exceptions

std::out_of_range if pos > size().

If an exception is thrown for any reason, these functions have no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Complexity

Linear in count.

### Notes

The allocator of the returned string is default-constructed: the new allocator might **not** be a copy of `get_allocator()`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::string a = "0123456789abcdefghij";
 
    // count is npos, returns pos, size())
    std::string sub1 = a.substr(10);
    std::cout << sub1 << '\n';
 
    // both pos and pos + count are within bounds, returns [pos, pos + count)
    std::string sub2 = a.substr(5, 3);
    std::cout << sub2 << '\n';
 
    // pos is within bounds, pos + count is not, returns [pos, size())
    std::string sub4 = a.substr(a.size() - 3, 50);
    // this is effectively equivalent to
    // std::string sub4 = a.substr(17, 3);
    // since a.size() == 20, pos == a.size() - 3 == 17, and a.size() - pos == 3
 
    std::cout << sub4 << '\n';
 
    try
    {
        // pos is out of bounds, throws
        std::string sub5 = a.substr(a.size() + 3, 50);
        std::cout << sub5 << '\n';
    }
    catch (const std::out_of_range& ex)
    {
        std::cout << ex.what() << '\n';
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
abcdefghij
567
hij
basic_string::substr: __pos (which is 23) > this->size() (which is 20)

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [LWG 847 | C++98 | there was no exception safety guarantee | added strong exception safety guarantee |
