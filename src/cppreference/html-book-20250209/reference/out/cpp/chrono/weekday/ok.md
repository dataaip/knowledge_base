Checks if the weekday value stored in \*this is in the valid range, i.e., `[`​0​`,`6`]`.

### Return value

true if the weekday value stored in \*this is in the range `[`​0​`,`6`]`. Otherwise false.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <string>
 
struct weekday_ok : std::numpunct<char>
{
    std::string do_truename()  const override { return " (is valid weekday)"; }
    std::string do_falsename() const override { return " (is not valid weekday)"; }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale(std::cout.getloc(), new weekday_ok));
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
 
    for (const unsigned u : {0 /* Sun */, 1 /* Mon */, 6, 7 /* Sun */, 8, 9})
    {
        const std::chrono::weekday wd{u};
        std::cout << "u: " << u << "; wd: " << wd.c_encoding() << wd.ok() << '\n';
    }
}

```

Output:

```
u: 0; wd: 0 (is valid weekday)
u: 1; wd: 1 (is valid weekday)
u: 6; wd: 6 (is valid weekday)
u: 7; wd: 0 (is valid weekday)
u: 8; wd: 8 (is not valid weekday)
u: 9; wd: 9 (is not valid weekday)

```
