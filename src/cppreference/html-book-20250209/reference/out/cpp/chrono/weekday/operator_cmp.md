| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| constexpr bool operator==( const std::chrono::weekday& x,                             const std::chrono::weekday& y ) noexcept; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Compare the two std::chrono::weekday x and y.

The `!=` operator is synthesized from `operator==`.

### Return value

x.c_encoding() == y.c_encoding()

### Notes

`weekday` does not support the `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` operators because there is no universal consensus on which day is the first day of the week.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
 
int main()
{
    using namespace std::literals;
 
    constexpr std::chrono::weekday wd1{2};
    constexpr std::chrono::weekday wd2{std::chrono::Friday};
    static_assert(wd1 != wd2);
 
    // 13 January 1313 is a Friday
    constexpr std::chrono::weekday wd3{1313y/1/13d};
    static_assert(wd2 == wd3);
}

```
