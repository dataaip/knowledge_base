Modifies the point in time \*this represents by one tick of the `duration`.

If `d_` is a member variable holding the duration (i.e., time since epoch) of this `time_point` object,

1) Equivalent to ++d_; return \*this;.2) Equivalent to return time_point(d_++).3) Equivalent to --d_; return \*this;.4) Equivalent to return time_point(d_--);.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1,3) A reference to this `time_point` after modification.2,4) A copy of the `time_point` made before modification.
