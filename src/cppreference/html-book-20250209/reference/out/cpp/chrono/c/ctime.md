| Defined in header `<ctime>` |  |  |
| char\* ctime( const std::time_t\* time ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Converts given time since epoch to a calendar local time and then to a textual representation, as if by calling std::asctime(std::localtime(time)). The resulting string has the following format:

```
Www Mmm dd hh:mm:ss yyyy\n

```

- `Www` - the day of the week (one of `Mon`, `Tue`, `Wed`, `Thu`, `Fri`, `Sat`, `Sun`).
- `Mmm` - the month (one of `Jan`, `Feb`, `Mar`, `Apr`, `May`, `Jun`, `Jul`, `Aug`, `Sep`, `Oct`, `Nov`, `Dec`).
- `dd` - the day of the month.
- `hh` - hours.
- `mm` - minutes.
- `ss` - seconds.
- `yyyy` - years.

The function does not support localization.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| time | - | pointer to a std::time_t object specifying the time to print |

### Return value

Pointer to a static null-terminated character string holding the textual representation of date and time. The string may be shared between std::asctime and `std::ctime`, and may be overwritten on each invocation of any of those functions.

### Notes

This function returns a pointer to static data and is not thread-safe. In addition, it modifies the static std::tm object which may be shared with std::gmtime and std::localtime. POSIX marks this function obsolete and recommends std::strftime instead.

The behavior may be undefined for the values of std::time_t that result in the string longer than 25 characters (e.g. year 10000).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <cstring>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::time_t result = std::time(nullptr);
    std::cout << std::ctime(&result);
 
    char buffer[32];
    std::strncpy(buffer, std::ctime(&result), 26);
    assert('\n' == buffer[std::strlen(buffer) - 1]);
    std::cout << buffer;
}

```

Possible output:

```
Mon Oct 11 17:10:55 2021
Mon Oct 11 17:10:55 2021

```
