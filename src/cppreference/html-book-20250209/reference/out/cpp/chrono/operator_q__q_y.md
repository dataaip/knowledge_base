| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| constexpr std::chrono::year operator""y( unsigned long long y ) noexcept; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Forms a std::chrono::year literal representing a year in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| y | - | the year value |

### Return value

A std::chrono::year initialized from int(y). If y is not in the range `[`-32767`,`32767`]`, the stored value is unspecified.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text constexpr std::chrono::year operator""y(unsigned long long y) noexcept {     return std::chrono::year(static_cast<int>(y)); } ``` |

### Notes

This operator is declared in the namespace std::literals::chrono_literals, where both literals and chrono_literals are inline namespaces. Access to this operator can be gained with:

- using namespace std::literals,
- using namespace std::chrono_literals, or
- using namespace std::literals::chrono_literals.

In addition, within the namespace std::chrono, the directive using namespace literals::chrono_literals; is provided by the standard library, so that if a programmer uses using namespace std::chrono; to gain access to the classes in the chrono library, the corresponding literal operators become visible as well.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    using namespace std::literals;
 
    std::cout << int(2020y)  << '\t' << 2020y  << '\n'
              << int(-220y)  << '\t' << -220y  << '\n'
              << int(3000y)  << '\t' << 3000y  << '\n'
              << int(32768y) << '\t' << 32768y << '\n'  // unspecified
              << int(65578y) << '\t' << 65578y << '\n'; // unspecified
}

```

Possible output:

```
2020	2020
-220	-0220
3000	3000
-32768	-32768 is not a valid year
42	0042

```
