An implementation of coroutine interface functions used internally to support operator co_yield.

(yielded is a reference type defined in std::generator.)

1) Assigns std::addressof(val) to `value_`. Returns {}.2) Returns an awaitable object x of an unspecified type that stores an object of type std::remove_cvref_t<`yielded`>. x is direct-non-list-initialized with lval, whose member functions are configured so that `value_` points to that stored object. Then suspends the coroutine.3, 4) Let x be some generator object.

Returns an awaitable object of an unspecified type into which g.range is moved,

- whose member await_ready returns false,
- whose member await_suspend pushes g.range.coroutine_ into \*x.`active_` and
- resumes execution of the coroutine referred to by g.range.coroutine_, and
- whose member await_resume evaluates

:   - std::rethrow_exception(except_) if bool(except_) is true.
    - If bool(except_) is false, the await_resume member has no effects.

 The coroutine referred to by g.range.coroutine_ must be suspended at its initial suspend point. Otherwise the behavior is undefined.5) Equivalent to:

```
auto nested = [](std::allocator_arg_t, Alloc, ranges::iterator_t<R> i,
                 ranges::sentinel_t<R> s) ->
    std::generator<yielded, void, Alloc>
{
    for (; i != s; ++i)
        co_yield static_cast<yielded>(*i);
};
 
return yield_value(ranges::elements_of(nested(
    allocator_arg, r.allocator, ranges::begin(r.range), ranges::end(r.range))));

```

2,3) A handle referring to the coroutine whose promise object is \*this must be at the top of \*`active_` of some generator object. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.2-5) A **yield-expression** that calls these overload has the type void.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| val | - | a value which is a result of the **yield-expression** evaluation |
| lval | - | an lvalue which is a result of the **yield-expression** evaluation |
| g | - | a range of elements produced by a generator |
| r | - | a range of elements |

### Return value

1) The awaitable object of type std::suspend_always.2-5) An awaitable object of an unspecified type as described above.

### Exceptions

2,5) May throw any exception thrown by the initialization of the stored object.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
