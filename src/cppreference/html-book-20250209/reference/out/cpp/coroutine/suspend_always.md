|  |  |  |

`suspend_always` is an empty class which can be used to indicate that an await expression always suspends and does not produce a value.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| await_ready | indicates that an await expression always suspends   (public member function) |
| await_suspend | no-op   (public member function) |
| await_resume | no-op   (public member function) |

## std::suspend_always::await_ready

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| constexpr bool await_ready() const noexcept { return false; } |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Always returns false, indicating that an await expression always suspends.

## std::suspend_always::await_suspend

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| constexpr void await_suspend( std::coroutine_handle<> ) const noexcept {} |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Does nothing.

## std::suspend_always::await_resume

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| constexpr void await_resume() const noexcept {} |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Does nothing. An await expression does not produce a value if `suspend_always` is used.
