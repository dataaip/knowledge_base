| string_type str( size_type n = 0 ) const; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Returns a string representing the indicated sub-match.

If n == 0, a string representing entire matched expression is returned.

If 0 < n && n < size(), a string representing nth sub-match is returned.

if n >= size(), a string representing the unmatched match is returned.

The call is equivalent to string_type((\*this)[n]);

`ready()` must be true. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | - | integral number specifying which match to return |

### Return value

Returns a string representing the specified match or sub match.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <regex>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::string target("baaaby");
    std::smatch sm;
 
    std::regex re1("a(a)*b");
    std::regex_search(target, sm, re1);
    std::cout << "entire match: " << sm.str(0) << '\n'
              << "submatch #1: " << sm.str(1) << '\n';
 
    std::regex re2("a(a*)b");
    std::regex_search(target, sm, re2);
    std::cout << "entire match: " << sm.str(0) << '\n'
              << "submatch #1: " << sm.str(1) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
entire match: aaab
submatch #1: a
entire match: aaab
submatch #1: aa

```
