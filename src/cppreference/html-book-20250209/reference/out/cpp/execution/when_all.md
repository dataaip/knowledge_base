| Defined in header `<execution>` |  |  |
| execution::sender auto when_all( execution::sender auto... inputs ); |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| inputs | - | senders upon which the completion of `when_all` is blocked. Can only include senders that can complete with a single set of values. |

### Return value

Returns a sender that completes once all of the input senders have completed. The values sent by this sender are the values sent by each of the input senders, in order of the arguments passed to `when_all`.

### Notes

- The sender returned by `when_all` completes inline on the execution resource on which the last input sender completes, unless `stop` is requested before `when_all` is started, in which case it completes inline within the call to start.
