| Defined in header `<ranges>` |  |  |
| template< class T >  concept range = requires( T& t ) {      ranges::begin(t); // equality-preserving for forward iterators      ranges::end (t); }; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The `range` concept defines the requirements of a type that allows iteration over its elements by providing an iterator and sentinel that denote the elements of the range.

### Semantic requirements

Given an expression E such that decltype((E)) is `T`, `T` models `range` only if

- ``[ranges::begin(E)`,`ranges::end(E)`)` denotes a range, and
- both ranges::begin(E) and ranges::end(E) are amortized constant time and do not alter the value of E in a manner observable to equality-preserving expressions, and
- if the type of ranges::begin(E) models `forward_iterator`, ranges::begin(E) is equality-preserving (in other words, forward iterators support multi-pass algorithms).

### Notes

A typical `range` class only needs to provide two functions:

1. A member function `begin()` whose return type models `input_or_output_iterator`.
2. A member function `end()` whose return type models `sentinel_for``<It>`, where `It` is the return type of `begin()`.

Alternatively, they can be non-member functions, to be found by argument-dependent lookup.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <ranges>
 
// A minimum range
struct SimpleRange
{
    int* begin();
    int* end();
};
static_assert(std::ranges::range<SimpleRange>);
 
// Not a range: no begin/end
struct NotRange
{
    int t {};
};
static_assert(!std::ranges::range<NotRange>);
 
// Not a range: begin does not return an input_or_output_iterator
struct NotRange2
{
    void* begin();
    int* end();
};
static_assert(!std::ranges::range<NotRange2>);
 
int main() {}

```
