| template< class R >  using keys_view = ranges::elements_view<R, 0>; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| namespace views {  inline constexpr auto keys = ranges::elements<0>; } | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Takes a `view` of **tuple-like** values (e.g. std::tuple or std::pair), and produces a view with a **value-type** of the **first** element of the adapted view's value-type.

1) An alias for ranges::elements_view<R, 0>.2) RangeAdaptorObject (and also RangeAdaptorClosureObject). The expression views::keys(e) is expression-equivalent to keys_view<views::all_t<decltype((e))>>{e} for any suitable subexpression e.

### Notes

keys_view can be useful for extracting **keys** from associative containers, e.g.

```
std::map<std::string, int> map{{"one", 1}, {"two", 2}};
 
for (auto const& key : std::views::keys(map))
    std::cout << key << ' ';
// prints: one two

```

### Example

Displays values for each type of quark in particle physics.

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <ranges>
#include <string>
#include <tuple>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    const std::vector<std::tuple<std::string, double, bool>> quark_mass_charge
    {
        // name, MeV/c², has positive electric-charge:
        {"up", 2.3, true}, {"down", 4.8, false},
        {"charm", 1275, true}, {"strange", 95, false},
        {"top", 173'210, true}, {"bottom", 4'180, false},
    };
 
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
    std::cout << "Quark name:  │ ";
    for (std::string const& name : std::views::keys(quark_mass_charge))
        std::cout << std::setw(9) << name << " │ ";
 
    std::cout << "\n" "Mass MeV/c²: │ ";
    for (const double mass : std::views::values(quark_mass_charge))
        std::cout << std::setw(9) << mass << " │ ";
 
    std::cout << "\n" "E-charge:    │ ";
    for (const bool pos : std::views::elements<2>(quark_mass_charge))
        std::cout << std::setw(9) << (pos ? "+2/3" : "-1/3") << " │ ";
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Quark name:  │        up │      down │     charm │   strange │       top │    bottom │
Mass MeV/c²: │       2.3 │       4.8 │     1,275 │        95 │   173,210 │     4,180 │
E-charge:    │      +2/3 │      -1/3 │      +2/3 │      -1/3 │      +2/3 │      -1/3 │

```

### Defect reports

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3563 | C++20 | `keys_view` is unable to participate in CTAD due to its use of views::all_t | views::all_t removed |
