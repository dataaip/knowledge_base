Increments or decrements the iterator.

Let `current_` be an underlying array of iterators.

1) Equivalent to:

```
for (auto& i : current_)
    i = std::ranges::next(i);
return *this;

```

The behavior is undefined if before the call the current_.back() is not incrementable.2) Equivalent to:

```
auto tmp = *this;
++*this;
return tmp;

```

3) Equivalent to:

```
for (auto& i : current_)
    i = std::ranges::prev(i);
return *this;

```

The behavior is undefined if before the call the current_.front() is not decrementable.4) Equivalent to:

```
auto tmp = *this;
--*this;
return tmp;

```

5) Equivalent to:

```
for (auto& i : current_)
    i = i + n;
return *this;

```

The behavior is undefined if before the call the current_.back() + n does not have well-defined behavior.6) Equivalent to:

```
for (auto& i : current_)
    i = i - n;
return *this;

```

The behavior is undefined if before the call the current_.front() - n does not have well-defined behavior.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | - | position relative to current location |

### Return value

1,3,5,6) \*this2,4) A copy of \*this that was made before the change.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <list>
#include <ranges>
#include <utility>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    {
        auto v = std::vector{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        auto i = (v | std::views::pairwise).begin();
        assert((*i == std::pair{0, 1}));
        ++i;                            // overload (1)
        assert((*i == std::pair{1, 2}));
        --i;                            // overload (3)
        assert((*i == std::pair{0, 1}));
        i += 2;                         // overload (5)
        assert((*i == std::pair{2, 3}));
        i -= 2;                         // overload (6)
        assert((*i == std::pair{0, 1}));
    }
    {
        auto v = std::list{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        auto i = (v | std::views::pairwise).begin();
        assert((*i == std::pair{0, 1}));
        ++i;                            // overload (1)
        assert((*i == std::pair{1, 2}));
        --i;                            // overload (3)
        assert((*i == std::pair{0, 1}));
//      i += 2; // Error: v is not a random_access_range; overload (5)
//      i -= 2; // Error: v is not a random_access_range; overload (6)
    }
}
