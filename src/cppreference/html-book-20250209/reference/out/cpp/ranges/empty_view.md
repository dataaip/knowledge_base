| Defined in header `<ranges>` |  |  |
| template<class T>      requires std::is_object_v<T> class empty_view : public ranges::view_interface<empty_view<T>> | (1) | (since C++20) |
| namespace views {  template<class T>      constexpr empty_view<T> empty{}; } | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

1) A range factory that produces a `view` of no elements of a particular type.2) Variable template for `empty_view`.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| begin[static] | returns nullptr   (public static member function) |
| end[static] | returns nullptr   (public static member function) |
| data[static] | returns nullptr   (public static member function) |
| size[static] | returns ​0​   (public static member function) |
| empty[static] | returns true   (public static member function) |
| Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface | |
| cbegin(C++23) | returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| cend(C++23) | returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| operator bool | returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| front | returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies `forward_range`.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| back | returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies `bidirectional_range` and `common_range`.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| [operator[]](view_interface/operator_at.html "cpp/ranges/view interface/operator at") | returns the `n`th element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies `random_access_range`.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |

## std::ranges::empty_view::begin

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| static constexpr T\* begin() noexcept { return nullptr; } |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

`empty_view` does not reference any element.

## std::ranges::empty_view::end

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| static constexpr T\* end() noexcept { return nullptr; } |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

`empty_view` does not reference any element.

## std::ranges::empty_view::data

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| static constexpr T\* data() noexcept { return nullptr; } |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

`empty_view` does not reference any element.

## std::ranges::empty_view::size

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| static constexpr std::size_t size() noexcept { return 0; } |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

`empty_view` is always empty.

## std::ranges::empty_view::empty

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| static constexpr bool empty() noexcept { return true; } |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

`empty_view` is always empty.

### Helper templates

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template<class T>  constexpr bool ranges::enable_borrowed_range<ranges::empty_view<T>> = true; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

This specialization of ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes `empty_view` satisfy `borrowed_range`.

### Notes

Although `empty_view` obtains `front`, `back`, and operator[] member functions from `view_interface`, calls to them always result in undefined behavior since an `empty_view` is always empty.

The inherited operator bool conversion function always returns false.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
    namespace ranges = std::ranges;
 
    ranges::empty_view<long> e;
    static_assert(ranges::empty(e)); // uses operator bool
    static_assert(0 == e.size());
    static_assert(nullptr == e.data());
    static_assert(nullptr == e.begin());
    static_assert(nullptr == e.end());
    static_assert(nullptr == e.cbegin());
    static_assert(nullptr == e.cend());
}

```
