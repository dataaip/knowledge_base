Calculates the number of elements in t in constant time, and converts the result to a signed type.

Given the subexpression of which t denotes the (possibly materialized) result object as E:

- If ranges::size(t) is ill-formed, ranges::ssize(E) is also ill-formed.
- Otherwise, let `Signed` be `make-signed-like-t` ﻿<decltype(ranges::size(t))>:
  - If std::ptrdiff_t is wider than `Signed`, ranges::ssize(E) is expression-equivalent to static_cast<std::ptrdiff_t>(ranges::size(t)).
  - Otherwise, ranges::ssize(E) is expression-equivalent to static_cast<Signed>(ranges::size(t)).

### Customization point objects

The name `ranges::ssize` denotes a **customization point object**, which is a const function object of a literal `semiregular` class type. For exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as `__ssize_fn`.

All instances of `__ssize_fn` are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type `__ssize_fn` on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, `ranges::ssize` can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types `Args...`, if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to `ranges::ssize` above, `__ssize_fn` models

- std::invocable<__ssize_fn, Args...>,
- std::invocable<const __ssize_fn, Args...>,
- std::invocable<__ssize_fn&, Args...>, and
- std::invocable<const __ssize_fn&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of `__ssize_fn` participates in overload resolution.

### Notes

If ranges::ssize(e) is valid for an expression e, the return type is a signed-integer-like type.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <array>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <type_traits>
 
int main()
{
    std::array arr{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    auto s = std::ranges::ssize(arr);
 
    std::cout << "ranges::ssize(arr) = " << s << '\n'
              << "ranges::ssize is "
              << (std::is_signed_v<decltype(s)> ? "signed" : "unsigned")
              << '\n';
 
    std::cout << "reversed arr: ";
 
    for (--s; s >= 0; --s)
        std::cout << arr[s] << ' ';
 
    std::cout << "\n" "s = " << s << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
ranges::ssize(arr) = 5
ranges::ssize is signed
reversed arr: 5 4 3 2 1
s = -1

```
