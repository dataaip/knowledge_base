| template< class T >  concept viewable_range =      ranges::range<T> &&      ((ranges::view<std::remove_cvref_t<T>> &&        std::constructible_from<std::remove_cvref_t<T>, T>) ||       (!ranges::view<std::remove_cvref_t<T>> &&        (std::is_lvalue_reference_v<T> || (std::movable<std::remove_reference_t<T>> && !/\*is-initializer-list\*/<T>)))); |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The `viewable_range` concept is a refinement of `range` that describes a range that can be converted into a `view` through views::all.

The constant /\*is-initializer-list\*/<T> is true if and only if std::remove_cvref_t<T> is a specialization of std::initializer_list.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <ranges>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
 
struct valid_result {};
struct invalid_result {};
 
template <typename T>
concept valid_viewable_range = std::same_as<T, valid_result>;
 
template <typename T>
concept invalid_viewable_range = std::same_as<T, invalid_result>;
 
auto test_viewable_range(std::ranges::viewable_range auto &&) -> valid_result;
auto test_viewable_range(auto&&) -> invalid_result;
 
int main()
{
    auto il = {1, 2, 3};
    int arr []{1, 2, 3};
    std::vector vec{1, 2, 3};
    std::ranges::ref_view r{arr};
    std::ranges::owning_view o{std::string("Hello")};
 
    static_assert(requires {
        { test_viewable_range(il) } -> valid_viewable_range;
        { test_viewable_range(std::move(il)) } -> invalid_viewable_range;
        { test_viewable_range(arr) } -> valid_viewable_range;
        { test_viewable_range(std::move(arr)) } -> invalid_viewable_range;
        { test_viewable_range(vec) } -> valid_viewable_range;
        { test_viewable_range(std::move(vec)) } -> valid_viewable_range;
        { test_viewable_range(r) } -> valid_viewable_range;
        { test_viewable_range(std::move(r)) } -> valid_viewable_range;
        { test_viewable_range(o) } -> invalid_viewable_range;
        { test_viewable_range(std::move(o)) } -> valid_viewable_range;
        { test_viewable_range(std::ranges::ref_view(o)) } -> valid_viewable_range;
    });
}

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3481 | C++20 | `viewable_range` accepted an lvalue of a move-only view | rejects |
| P2415R2 | C++20 | `viewable_range` only accepted non-`view` rvalues that are `borrowed_range` | accepts more types |
