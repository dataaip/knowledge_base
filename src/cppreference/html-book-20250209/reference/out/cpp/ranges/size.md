Calculates the number of elements in t in constant time.

Given the subexpression of which t denotes the (possibly materialized) result object as E, and the type of E as `T`:

- If `T` is an array of unknown bound, ranges::size(E) is ill-formed.
- Otherwise, if `T` is an array type, ranges::size(E) is expression-equivalent to **decay-copy** ﻿(std::extent_v<T>)(until C++23)auto(std::extent_v<T>)(since C++23).
- Otherwise, if all following conditions are satisfied, ranges::size(E) is expression-equivalent to **decay-copy** ﻿(t.size())(until C++23)auto(t.size())(since C++23):
  - ranges::disable_sized_range<std::remove_cv_t<T>> is false.
  - **decay-copy** ﻿(t.size())(until C++23)auto(t.size())(since C++23) is a valid expression of integer-like type.
- Otherwise, if all following conditions are satisfied, ranges::size(E) is expression-equivalent to **decay-copy** ﻿(size(t))(until C++23)auto(size(t))(since C++23):
  - `T` is a class or enumeration type.
  - ranges::disable_sized_range<std::remove_cv_t<T>> is false.
  - **decay-copy** ﻿(size(t))(until C++23)auto(size(t))(since C++23) is a valid expression of integer-like type, where the meaning of `size` is established as if by performing argument-dependent lookup only.
- Otherwise, if all following conditions are satisfied, ranges::size(E) is expression-equivalent to `to-unsigned-like` ﻿(ranges::end(t) - ranges::begin(t)):
  - `T` models `forward_range`.
  - Given the type of ranges::begin(t) as `I` and the type of ranges::end(t) as `S`, both `sized_sentinel_for`<S, I> and `forward_iterator`<I> are modeled.
  - `to-unsigned-like` ﻿(ranges::end(t) - ranges::begin(t)) is a valid expression.
- Otherwise, ranges::size(E) is ill-formed.

Diagnosable ill-formed cases above result in substitution failure when ranges::size(E) appears in the immediate context of a template instantiation.

### Customization point objects

The name `ranges::size` denotes a **customization point object**, which is a const function object of a literal `semiregular` class type. For exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as `__size_fn`.

All instances of `__size_fn` are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type `__size_fn` on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, `ranges::size` can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types `Args...`, if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to `ranges::size` above, `__size_fn` models

- std::invocable<__size_fn, Args...>,
- std::invocable<const __size_fn, Args...>,
- std::invocable<__size_fn&, Args...>, and
- std::invocable<const __size_fn&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of `__size_fn` participates in overload resolution.

### Notes

Whenever ranges::size(e) is valid for an expression e, the return type is integer-like.

The C++20 standard requires that if the underlying `size` function call returns a prvalue, the return value is move-constructed from the materialized temporary object. All implementations directly return the prvalue instead. The requirement is corrected by the post-C++20 proposal P0849R8 to match the implementations.

The expression ranges::distance(e) can also be used to determine the size of a range e. Unlike ranges::size(e), ranges::distance(e) works even if e is an unsized range, at the cost of having linear complexity in that case.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <type_traits>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    auto v = std::vector<int>{};
    std::cout << "ranges::size(v) == " << std::ranges::size(v) << '\n';
 
    auto il = {7};     // std::initializer_list
    std::cout << "ranges::size(il) == " << std::ranges::size(il) << '\n';
 
    int array[]{4, 5}; // array has a known bound
    std::cout << "ranges::size(array) == " << std::ranges::size(array) << '\n';
 
    static_assert(std::is_signed_v<decltype(std::ranges::size(v))> == false);
}

```

Output:

```
ranges::size(v) == 0
ranges::size(il) == 1
ranges::size(array) == 2

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P2602R2 | C++20 | there's machinery to prohibit certain non-member `size` found by ADL | removed such machinery |
