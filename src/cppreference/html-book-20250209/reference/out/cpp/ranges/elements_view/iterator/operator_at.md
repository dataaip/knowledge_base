| constexpr decltype(auto) operator[]( difference_type n ) const      requires ranges::random_access_range<Base>; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Returns an element at specified relative location, as if by /\*get-element\*/(this->base() + n), where for an expression e, /\*get-element\*/(e) is

- std::get<N>(\*e), if ranges::range_reference_t<Base> is a reference type. Otherwise,
- static_cast<E>(std::get<N>(\*e)), where E is std::remove_cv_t<std::tuple_element_t<N, ranges::range_reference_t<Base>>>.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | - | position relative to current location |

### Return value

The element at displacement n relative to the current location.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
#include <tuple>
 
int main()
{
    using T = std::tuple<int, char, std::string_view>;
 
    const auto il =
    {
        T{1, 'A', "α"},
        T{2, 'B', "β"},
        T{3, 'C', "γ"},
    };
 
    std::cout << std::views::elements<0>(il)[1] << ' '   // 2
              << std::views::elements<1>(il)[1] << ' '   // B
              << std::views::elements<2>(il)[1] << '\n'; // β
}

```

Output:

```
2 B β

```
