| Defined in header `<ranges>` |  |  |
| template< ranges::range R, class Allocator = std::allocator<std::byte> >  struct elements_of; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Encapsulates a `range`. Specializations of `elements_of` act as a tag in overload sets to disambiguate when a range should be treated as a sequence rather than a single value.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R | - | a type that satisfies `range` |
| Allocator | - | an allocator type that meets the requirements of Allocator |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member name | Definition |
| range | a range of type `R`   (public member object) |
| allocator | an allocator of type `Allocator`. It has default member initializer that value initializes itself   (public member object) |

All these members are declared with `[[no_unique_address]]` attribute.

### Deduction guide

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template< class R, class Allocator = std::allocator<std::byte> >  elements_of( R&&, Allocator = Allocator() ) -> elements_of<R&&, Allocator>; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <any>
#include <generator>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
 
template<bool Elementwise>
std::generator<std::any> gen(std::ranges::input_range auto&& r)
{
    if constexpr (Elementwise)
        co_yield std::ranges::elements_of(r); // yield each element of r
    else
        co_yield r;                           // yield r as a single value
}
 
int main()
{
    auto test = std::string_view{"test"};
 
    for (std::any a : gen<true>(test))
        std::cout << '[' << std::any_cast<char>(a) << "] ";
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    for (std::any a : gen<false>(test))
        std::cout << '[' << std::any_cast<std::string_view>(a) << "] ";
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
[t] [e] [s] [t] 
[test]

```
