| constexpr subrange next( std::iter_difference_t<I> n = 1 ) const&      requires std::forward_iterator<I>; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| constexpr subrange next( std::iter_difference_t<I> n = 1 ) &&; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Returns a `subrange` whose `begin_` is incremented (or decremented if n is negative). The actual increment (or decrement) operation is performed by `advance()`.

1) Returns a copy of \*this. Equivalent to: auto tmp = \*this;  
tmp.advance(n);  
return tmp;.2) Returns a `subrange` moved from \*this. Equivalent to: advance(n);  
return std::move(\*this);.

### Parameter

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | - | number of maximal increments of the iterator |

### Return value

As described above.

### Notes

The difference between this function and `advance()` is that the latter performs the increment (or decrement) in place.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <array>
#include <iterator>
#include <print>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
    std::array arr{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    std::ranges::subrange sub{std::next(arr.begin(), 2), std::prev(arr.end(), 2)};
    std::println("1) sub: {}", sub);
    std::println("2) sub: {}", sub.next());
    std::println("3) sub: {}", sub.next(2));
}

```

Output:

```
1) sub: [3, 4, 5]
2) sub: [4, 5]
3) sub: [5]

```
