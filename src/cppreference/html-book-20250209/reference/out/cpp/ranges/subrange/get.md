Provides structured binding support.

1) Obtains the iterator or sentinel from a `subrange` lvalue (or a const rvalue) when N == 0 or N == 1, respectively.2) Same as (1), except that it takes a non-const `subrange` rvalue.3) Overloads (1,2) are imported into namespace `std`, which simplifies their usage and makes every `subrange` with a copyable iterator a pair-like type.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| r | - | a `subrange` |

### Return value

1,2) If N is ​0​, returns r.begin(). Otherwise (N is 1), returns r.end().

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <array>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
    std::array a{1, -2, 3, -4};
 
    std::ranges::subrange sub_a{std::next(a.begin()), std::prev(a.end())};
    std::cout << *std::ranges::get<0>(sub_a) << ' '   // == *(begin(a) + 1)
              << *std::ranges::get<1>(sub_a) << '\n'; // == *(end(a) - 1)
 
    *std::get<0>(sub_a) = 42; // OK
//  *std::get<2>(sub_a) = 13; // Error: index can only be 0 or 1
}

```

Output:

```
-2 -4

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3589 | C++20 | overload (1) copies `begin_` if N is ​0​, but `I` might not model `copyable` | added constraints |
