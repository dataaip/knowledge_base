Returns an iterator to the first element of the `cartesian_product_view`.

Let `bases_` be the tuple of underlying views.

1) Equivalent to return /\*iterator\*/<false>(`tuple-transform`(ranges::begin, bases_));.2) Equivalent to return /\*iterator\*/<true>(`tuple-transform`(ranges::begin, bases_));.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

An iterator to the first element.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <array>
#include <format>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
#include <tuple>
using namespace std::literals;
 
int main()
{
    constexpr auto a = std::array{"Curiously"sv, "Recurring"sv, "Template"sv, "Pattern"sv};
 
    constexpr auto v = std::ranges::cartesian_product_view(a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);
 
    constexpr std::tuple<char const&,
                         char const&,
                         char const&,
                         char const&> first{*v.begin()};
 
    std::cout << std::format("{}{}{}{}{}",
                             std::get<0>(first),
                             std::get<1>(first),
                             std::get<2>(first),
                             std::get<3>(first),
                             '\n');
}

```

Output:

```
CRTP

```
