| Member functions | | | | |

|  |  |  |

Class template `std::time_put` encapsulates date and time formatting rules. The I/O manipulator std::put_time uses the `std::time_put` facet of the I/O stream's locale to generate text representation of an std::tm object.

Inheritance diagram

If a `std::time_put` specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its put() and do_put() are not guaranteed as specified.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<locale>` | |
| std::time_put<char> | creates narrow string representations of date and time |
| std::time_put<wchar_t> | creates wide string representations of date and time |

In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:

- `CharT` is one of char and wchar_t, and
- `OutputIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `char_type` | `CharT` |
| `iter_type` | `OutputIt` |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member | Description |
| std::locale::id `id` [static] | the identifier of the facet |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a new `time_put` facet   (public member function) |
| (destructor) | destructs a `time_put` facet   (protected member function) |
| put | invokes `do_put`   (public member function) |

### Protected member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| do_put[virtual] | formats date/time and writes to output stream   (virtual protected member function) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <codecvt>
#include <ctime>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);
    std::wbuffer_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>> conv(std::cout.rdbuf());
    std::wostream out(&conv);
    out.imbue(std::locale("ja_JP.utf8"));
 
    // this I/O manipulator std::put_time uses std::time_put<wchar_t>
    out << std::put_time(std::localtime(&t), L"%A %c") << '\n';
}

```

Output:
