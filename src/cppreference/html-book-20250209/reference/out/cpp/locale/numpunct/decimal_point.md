| public:  char_type decimal_point() const; | (1) |  |
| protected:  virtual char_type do_decimal_point() const; | (2) |  |
|  |  |  |

1) Public member function, calls the member function `do_decimal_point` of the most derived class.2) Returns the character to be used as the decimal separator between integer and fractional parts.

### Return value

The value of type `char_type` to use as the decimal separator. The standard specializations of `std::numpunct` return '.' and L'.'.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
struct slash : std::numpunct<char>
{
    char do_decimal_point() const { return '/'; }  // separate with slash
};
 
int main()
{
    std::cout.precision(10);
    std::cout << "default locale: " << 1234.5678 << '\n';
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale(std::cout.getloc(), new slash));
    std::cout << "locale with modified numpunct: " << 1234.5678 << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
default locale: 1234.5678
locale with modified numpunct: 1234/5678

```
