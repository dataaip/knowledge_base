| public:  string_type negative_sign() const; | (2) |  |

1) Public member function, calls the member function `do_positive_sign` of the most derived class.2) Public member function, calls the member function `do_negative_sign` of the most derived class.3) Returns the string that is used for formatting of positive monetary values.3) Returns the string that is used for formatting of negative monetary values.

Only the first character of the string returned is the character that appears in the pos_format()/neg_format() position indicated by the value sign. The rest of the characters appear **after** the rest of the monetary string.

In particular, for negative_sign of "-", the formatting may appear as "-1.23 €", while for negative_sign of "()" it would appear as "(1.23 €)".

### Return value

The string of type `string_type` holding the characters to be used as positive or negative sign.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
struct my_punct : std::moneypunct_byname<char, false>
{
    my_punct(const char* name) : moneypunct_byname(name) {}
    string_type do_negative_sign() const { return "()"; }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::locale loc("de_DE.utf8");
    std::cout.imbue(loc);
    std::cout << loc.name() << " negative sign is '"
              << std::use_facet<std::moneypunct<char>>(loc).negative_sign()
              << "' for example: " << std::showbase << std::put_money(-1234) << '\n';
 
    std::locale loc2("ms_MY.utf8");
    std::cout.imbue(loc2);
    std::cout << loc2.name() << " negative sign is '"
              << std::use_facet<std::moneypunct<char>>(loc2).negative_sign()
              << "' for example: " << std::put_money(-1234) << '\n';
 
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale(std::cout.getloc(), new my_punct("de_DE.utf8")));
    std::cout << "de_DE.utf8 with negative_sign set to \"()\": "
              << std::put_money(-1234) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
de_DE.utf8 negative sign is '-' for example: -12,34 €
ms_MY.utf8 negative sign is '()' for example: (RM12.34)
de_DE.utf8 with negative_sign set to "()": (12,34 €)

```
