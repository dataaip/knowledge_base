Destructs a std::moneypunct facet. This destructor is protected and virtual (due to base class destructor being virtual). An object of type std::moneypunct, like most facets, can only be destroyed when the last std::locale object that implements this facet goes out of scope or if a user-defined class is derived from std::moneypunct and implements a public destructor.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
struct Destructible_moneypunct : public std::moneypunct<wchar_t>
{
    Destructible_moneypunct(std::size_t refs = 0) : moneypunct(refs) {}
    // note: the implicit destructor is public
};
 
int main()
{
    Destructible_moneypunct dc;
    // std::moneypunct<wchar_t> c; // compile error: protected destructor
}

```
