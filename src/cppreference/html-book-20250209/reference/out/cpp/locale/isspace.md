| Defined in header `<locale>` |  |  |
| template< class CharT >  bool isspace( CharT ch, const locale& loc ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Checks if the given character is classified as a whitespace character by the given locale's std::ctype facet.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ch | - | character |
| loc | - | locale |

### Return value

Returns true if the character is classified as a whitespace character, false otherwise.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class CharT> bool isspace(CharT ch, const std::locale& loc) {     return std::use_facet<std::ctype<CharT>>(loc).is(std::ctype_base::space, ch); } ``` |

### Example

Demonstrates the use of `std::isspace()` with different locales (OS-specific).

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
void try_with(wchar_t c, const char* loc)
{
    std::wcout << "isspace('" << c << "', locale(\"" << loc << "\")) returned "
               << std::boolalpha << std::isspace(c, std::locale(loc)) << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    const wchar_t EM_SPACE = L'\u2003'; // Unicode character 'EM SPACE'
    try_with(EM_SPACE, "C");
    try_with(EM_SPACE, "en_US.UTF8");
}

```

Possible output:

```
isspace(' ', locale("C")) returned false
isspace(' ', locale("en_US.UTF8")) returned true

```
