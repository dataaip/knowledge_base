1-3) Computes the principal value of the arc cosine of num. The library provides overloads of `std::acos` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter.(since C++23)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| S) The SIMD overload performs an element-wise `std::acos` on v_num. (See **math-floating-point** and **deduced-simd-t** for their definitions.) | (since C++26) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double. | (since C++11) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| num | - | floating-point or integer value |

### Return value

If no errors occur, the arc cosine of num (arccos(num)) in the range [0, π], is returned.

If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where supported).

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

Domain error occurs if num is outside the range `[`-1.0`,`1.0`]`.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If the argument is +1, the value `+0` is returned.
- If |num| > 1, a domain error occurs and NaN is returned.
- if the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::acos(num) has the same effect as std::acos(static_cast<double>(num)).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cerrno>
#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
 
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "acos(-1) = " << std::acos(-1) << '\n'
              << "acos(0.0) = " << std::acos(0.0) << '\n'
              << "2*acos(0.0) = " << 2 * std::acos(0) << '\n'
              << "acos(0.5) = " << std::acos(0.5) << '\n'
              << "3*acos(0.5) = " << 3 * std::acos(0.5) << '\n'
              << "acos(1) = " << std::acos(1) << '\n';
 
    // error handling
    errno = 0;
    std::feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
 
    std::cout << "acos(1.1) = " << std::acos(1.1) << '\n';
 
    if (errno == EDOM)
        std::cout << "    errno == EDOM: " << std::strerror(errno) << '\n';
    if (std::fetestexcept(FE_INVALID))
        std::cout << "    FE_INVALID raised" << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
acos(-1) = 3.14159
acos(0.0) = 1.5708
2*acos(0.0) = 3.14159
acos(0.5) = 1.0472
3*acos(0.5) = 3.14159
acos(1) = 0
acos(1.1) = nan
    errno == EDOM: Numerical argument out of domain
    FE_INVALID raised

```
