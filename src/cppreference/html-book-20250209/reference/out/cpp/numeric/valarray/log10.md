| Defined in header `<valarray>` |  |  |
| template< class T >  valarray<T> log10( const valarray<T>& va ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

For each element in va computes common (base 10) logarithm of the value of the element.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| va | - | value array to apply the operation to |

### Return value

Value array containing common logarithms of the values in va.

### Notes

Unqualified function (log10) is used to perform the computation. If such function is not available, std::log10 is used due to argument-dependent lookup.

The function can be implemented with the return type different from std::valarray. In this case, the replacement type has the following properties:

:   - All const member functions of std::valarray are provided.
    - std::valarray, std::slice_array, std::gslice_array, std::mask_array and std::indirect_array can be constructed from the replacement type.
    - For every function taking a const std::valarray<T>& except begin() and end()(since C++11), identical functions taking the replacement types shall be added;
    - For every function taking two const std::valarray<T>& arguments, identical functions taking every combination of const std::valarray<T>& and replacement types shall be added.
    - The return type does not add more than two levels of template nesting over the most deeply-nested argument type.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class T> valarray<T> log10(const valarray<T>& va) {     valarray<T> other = va;     for (T& i : other)         i = log10(i);       return other; // proxy object may be returned } ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <valarray>
 
void show(char const* title, const std::valarray<float>& va)
{
    std::cout << title << " : " << std::right;
    for (float x : va)
        std::cout << std::setw(6) << x;
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    const std::valarray<float> n{-2.f, -1.f, 0.f, 1.f, 2.f, 3.f, INFINITY};
    const std::valarray<float> pow10{std::pow(10.f, n)};
    const std::valarray<float> log10_pow10{std::log10(pow10)};
 
    show("n      ", n);
    show("10ⁿ    ", pow10);
    show("lg(10ⁿ)", log10_pow10);
}

```

Output:

```
n       :     -2    -1     0     1     2     3   inf
10ⁿ     :   0.01   0.1     1    10   100  1000   inf
lg(10ⁿ) :     -2    -1     0     1     2     3   inf

```
