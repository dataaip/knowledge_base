| Defined in header `<valarray>` |  |  |
| template< class T >  valarray<T> cos( const valarray<T>& va ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

For each element in va computes cosine of the value of the element.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| va | - | value array to apply the operation to |

### Return value

Value array containing cosines of the values in va.

### Notes

Unqualified function (cos) is used to perform the computation. If such function is not available, std::cos is used due to argument-dependent lookup.

The function can be implemented with the return type different from std::valarray. In this case, the replacement type has the following properties:

:   - All const member functions of std::valarray are provided.
    - std::valarray, std::slice_array, std::gslice_array, std::mask_array and std::indirect_array can be constructed from the replacement type.
    - For every function taking a const std::valarray<T>& except begin() and end()(since C++11), identical functions taking the replacement types shall be added;
    - For every function taking two const std::valarray<T>& arguments, identical functions taking every combination of const std::valarray<T>& and replacement types shall be added.
    - The return type does not add more than two levels of template nesting over the most deeply-nested argument type.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class T> valarray<T> cos(const valarray<T>& va) {     valarray<T> other = va;     for (T& i : other)         i = cos(i);       return other; // proxy object may be returned } ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <valarray>
 
void show(const char* title, const std::valarray<float>& data)
{
    const int w{9};
    std::cout << std::setw(w) << title << " | ";
    for (float x : data)
        std::cout << std::setw(w) << x << " | ";
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    const std::valarray<float> x{.1, .2, .3, .4};
    const auto sin = std::sin(x);
    const auto cos = std::cos(x);
    const auto z = (sin * sin) + (cos * cos);
 
    show("x", x);
    show("sin(x)", sin);
    show("cos(x)", cos);
    show("z", z);
}

```

Output:

```

        x |       0.1 |       0.2 |       0.3 |       0.4 | 
   sin(x) | 0.0998334 |  0.198669 |   0.29552 |  0.389418 | 
   cos(x) |  0.995004 |  0.980067 |  0.955337 |  0.921061 | 
        z |         1 |         1 |         1 |         1 |

```
