Compares two distribution objects. Two distribution objects are equal when parameter values and internal state is the same.

1) Compares two distribution objects for equality.2) Compares two distribution objects for inequality.

These functions are not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::discrete_distribution<ResultType> is an associated class of the arguments.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The `!=` operator is synthesized from `operator==`. | (since C++20) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | distribution objects to compare |

### Return value

1) true if the distribution objects are equal, false otherwise.2) true if the distribution objects are not equal, false otherwise.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |

| LWG 3519 | C++11 | the form of equality operators were unspecified (could be hidden friends or free function templates) | specified to be hidden friends |
