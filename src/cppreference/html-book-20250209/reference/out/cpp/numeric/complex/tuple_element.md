| ****tuple_element<std::complex>****(C++26) | | | | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<complex>` |  |  |
| template< std::size_t I, class T >  struct tuple_element<I, std::complex<T>>; |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

The partial specializations of std::tuple_element for std::complex provide compile-time access to the underlying real and imaginary number type of a `complex`, using tuple-like syntax. They are provided for structured binding support. The program is ill-formed if I >= 2.

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member type | Definition |
| `type` | `T` |

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_tuple_like` | `202311L` | (C++26) | Add tuple protocol to std::complex |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <complex>
#include <type_traits>
 
static_assert([z = std::complex<float>()]
{
    using T = decltype(z);
    return
#if __cpp_lib_tuple_like >= 202311L
        std::is_same_v<std::tuple_element_t<0, T>, float> &&
        std::is_same_v<std::tuple_element_t<1, T>, float> &&
#endif
        std::is_same_v<T::value_type, float>;
}());
 
int main() {}

```
