| template< class T >  constexpr T bit_floor( T x ) noexcept; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

If x is not zero, calculates the largest integral power of two that is not greater than x. If x is zero, returns zero.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if `T` is an unsigned integer type (that is, unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long, unsigned long long, or an extended unsigned integer type).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | - | unsigned integer value |

### Return value

Zero if x is zero; otherwise, the largest integral power of two that is not greater than x.

### Notes

Prior to P1956R1, the proposed name for this function template was `floor2`.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_int_pow2` | `202002L` | (C++20) | Integral power-of-2 operations |

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<std::unsigned_integral T>     requires !std::same_as<T, bool> && !std::same_as<T, char> &&              !std::same_as<T, char8_t> && !std::same_as<T, char16_t> &&              !std::same_as<T, char32_t> && !std::same_as<T, wchar_t> constexpr T bit_floor(T x) noexcept {     if (x != 0)         return T{1} << (std::bit_width(x) - 1);     return 0; } ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <bit>
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    using bin = std::bitset<8>;
    for (unsigned x{}; x != 012; ++x)
        std::cout << "bit_floor( " << bin(x) << " ) = "
                  << bin(std::bit_floor(x)) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
bit_floor( 00000000 ) = 00000000
bit_floor( 00000001 ) = 00000001
bit_floor( 00000010 ) = 00000010
bit_floor( 00000011 ) = 00000010
bit_floor( 00000100 ) = 00000100
bit_floor( 00000101 ) = 00000100
bit_floor( 00000110 ) = 00000100
bit_floor( 00000111 ) = 00000100
bit_floor( 00001000 ) = 00001000
bit_floor( 00001001 ) = 00001000

```
