The library provides data-parallel types and operations on these types: portable types for explicitly stating data-parallelism and structuring data through data-parallel execution resources where available, such as SIMD registers and instructions or execution units that are driven by a common instruction decoder.

All standard integer types, character types, and most floating-point types are **vectorizable types**. Vectorizable floating-point types include float, double, and the selected extended floating-point types std::float16_t, std::float32_t, and std::float64_t if defined.

A **data-parallel type** consists of one or more elements of an underlying vectorizable type, called the **element type**. The number of elements, called the **width**, is constant for each data-parallel type.

The data-parallel type refers to all enabled specializations of the class templates `basic_simd` and `basic_simd_mask`.

A **data-parallel object** of data-parallel type behaves analogously to objects of type `T`. But while `T` stores and manipulates a single value, the data-parallel type with the element type `T` stores and manipulates multiple values.

Every operation on a data-parallel object acts **element-wise** (except for horizontal operations, such as reductions, which are clearly marked as such) applying to each element of the object or to corresponding elements of two objects. Each such application is unsequenced with respect to the others. This simple rule expresses data-parallelism and will be used by the compiler to generate SIMD instructions and/or independent execution streams.

All operations (except non-constexpr math function overloads) on data-parallel objects are constexpr: it is possible to create and use data-parallel objects in the evaluation of a constant expression.

Alias templates `simd` and `simd_mask` are defined to allow users to specify the width to a certain size. The default width is determined by the implementation at compile-time.

### Implementation details

#### ABI tags

The data-parallel types `basic_simd` and `basic_simd_mask` are associated with **ABI tags**. These tags are types that specify the size and binary representation of data-parallel objects. The design intends the size and binary representation to vary based on target architecture and compiler flags. The ABI tag, together with the element type, determines the width.

The ABI tag remains independent of machine instruction set selection. The chosen machine instruction set limits the usable ABI tag types. The ABI tags enable users to safely pass objects of data-parallel type across translation unit boundaries.

#### Exposition-only entities

| --- | --- | --- |
| using /\*simd-size-type\*/ = /\* see description \*/; | (1) | (exposition only\*) |
| template< std::size_t Bytes >  using /\*integer-from\*/ = /\* see description \*/; | (2) | (exposition only\*) |
| template< class T, class Abi >  constexpr /\*simd-size-type\*/ /\*simd-size-v\*/ = /\* see description \*/; | (3) | (exposition only\*) |
| template< class T >  constexpr std::size_t /\*mask-element-size\*/ = /\* see description \*/; | (4) | (exposition only\*) |
| template< class T >  concept /\*constexpr-wrapper-like\*/ = /\* see description \*/; | (5) | (exposition only\*) |
| template< class T >  using /\*deduced-simd-t\*/ = /\* see description \*/; | (6) | (exposition only\*) |
| template< class V, class T >  using /\*make-compatible-simd-t\*/ = /\* see description \*/; | (7) | (exposition only\*) |
|  |  |  |

1) /\*simd-size-type\*/ is an alias for for a signed integer type. The implementation is free to choose any signed integer type.2) /\*integer-from\*/<Bytes> is an alias for a signed integer type `T` such that sizeof(T) equals Bytes.3) /\*simd-size-v\*/<T, Abi> denotes the width of the enabled specialization `basic_simd<T, Abi>`, or â€‹0â€‹ otherwise.4) If `T` denotes std::basic_simd_mask<Bytes, Abi>, /\*mask-element-size\*/<T> equals Bytes.5) The concept /\*constexpr-wrapper-like\*/ is defined as:

```
template< class T >
concept /*constexpr-wrapper-like*/ =
    std::convertible_to<T, decltype(T::value)> &&
    std::equality_comparable_with<T, decltype(T::value)> &&
    std::bool_constant<T() == T::value>::value &&
    std::bool_constant<static_cast<decltype(T::value)>(T()) == T::value>::value;

```

6) Let x be an lvalue of type const T. /\*deduced-simd-t\*/<T> is an alias equivalent to:

- decltype(x + x), if the type of x + x is an enabled specialization of `basic_simd`; otherwise
- void.
7) Let x be an lvalue of type const T. /\*make-compatible-simd-t\*/<V, T> is an alias equivalent to:

- /\*deduced-simd-t\*/<T>, if that type is not void, otherwise
- std::simd<decltype(x + x), Vâ€‹::â€‹size()>.

| Math functions requirements |  |  |
| template< class V >  concept /\*simd-floating-point\*/ = /\* see description \*/; | (8) | (exposition only\*) |
| template< class... Ts >  concept /\*math-floating-point\*/ = /\* see description \*/; | (9) | (exposition only\*) |
| template< class... Ts >  Â  requires /\*math-floating-point\*/<Ts...> using /\*math-common-simd-t\*/ = /\* see description \*/; | (10) | (exposition only\*) |
| template< class BinaryOp, class T >  concept /\*reduction-binary-operation\*/ = /\* see description \*/; | (11) | (exposition only\*) |
|  |  |  |

8) The concept /\*simd-floating-point\*/ is defined as:

```
template< class V >
concept /*simd-floating-point*/ =
    std::same_as<V, std::basic_simd<typename V::value_type, typename V::abi_type>> &&
    std::is_default_constructible_v<V> && 
    std::floating_point<typename V::value_type>;

```

9) The concept /\*math-floating-point\*/ is defined as:

```
template< class... Ts >
concept /*math-floating-point*/ =
    (/*simd-floating-point*/</*deduced-simd-t*/<Ts>> || ...);

```

10) Let `T0` denote Ts...[0], `T1` denote Ts...[1], and `TRest` denote a pack such that T0, T1, TRest... is equivalent to Ts.... Then, /\*math-common-simd-t\*/<Ts...> is an alias equivalent to:

- /\*deduced-simd-t\*/<T0>, if sizeof...(Ts) == 1 is true
- otherwise, std::common_type_t</\*deduced-simd-t\*/<T0>, /\*deduced-simd-t\*/<T1>>, if sizeof...(Ts) == 2 is true and /\*math-floating-point\*/<T0> && /\*math-floating-point\*/<T1> is true,
- otherwise, std::common_type_t</\*deduced-simd-t\*/<T0>, T1> if sizeof...(Ts) == 2 is true and /\*math-floating-point\*/<T0> is true,
- otherwise, std::common_type_t<T0, /\*deduced-simd-t\*/<T1>> if sizeof...(Ts) == 2 is true,
- otherwise, std::common_type_t</\*math-common-simd-t\*/<T0, T1>, TRest...>, if /\*math-common-simd-t\*/<T0, T1> is a valid type,
- otherwise, std::common_type_t</\*math-common-simd-t\*/<TRest...>, T0, T1>.
11) The concept /\*reduction-binary-operation\*/ is defined as:

```
template< class BinaryOp, class T >
concept /*reduction-binary-operation*/ =
    requires (const BinaryOp binary_op, const std::simd<T, 1> v) {
        { binary_op(v, v) } -> std::same_as<std::simd<T, 1>>;
    };

```

/\*reduction-binary-operation\*/<BinaryOp, T> is modeled only if:

:   - `BinaryOp` is a binary element-wise operation that is commutative, and
    - An object of type `BinaryOp` is invocable with two arguments of type std::basic_simd<T, Abi> for unspecified ABI tag `Abi` that returns a std::basic_simd<T, Abi>.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SIMD ABI tags |  |  |
| template< class T >  using /\*native-abi\*/ = /\* see description \*/; | (12) | (exposition only\*) |
| template< class T, /\*simd-size-type\*/ N >  using /\*deduce-abi-t\*/ = /\* see description \*/; | (13) | (exposition only\*) |
|  |  |  |

12) /\*native-abi\*/<T> is an implementation-defined alias for an ABI tag. This is the primary ABI tag to use for efficient explicit vectorization. As a result, basic_simd<T, /\*native-abi\*/<T>> is an enabled specialization.13) /\*deduce-abi-t\*/<T, N> is an alias that names an ABI tag type such that:

- /\*simd-size-v\*/<T, /\*deduce-abi-t\*/<T, N>> equals N,
- std::basic_simd<T, /\*deduce-abi-t\*/<T, N>> is an enabled specialization, and
- std::basic_simd_mask<sizeof(T), /\*deduce-abi-t\*/</\*integer-from\*/<sizeof(T)>, N>> is an enabled specialization.

It is defined only if `T` is a vectorizable type, and N > 0 && N <= M is true, where M is an implementation-defined maximum that is at least 64 and can differ depending on `T`.

| template< std::size_t N >  struct /\*overaligned-flag\*/; | (16) | (exposition only\*) |
|  |  |  |

14-16) These tag types are used as a template argument of `std::simd_flags`. See load and store flags") for their corresponding uses.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <simd>
#include <string_view>
Â 
void println(std::string_view name, auto const& a)
{
    std::cout << name << ": ";
    for (std::size_t i{}; i != a.size(); ++i)
        std::cout << a[i] << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}
Â 
template<class A>
constexpr std::basic_simd<int, A> my_abs(std::basic_simd<int, A> x)
{
    return std::simd_select(x < 0, -x, x);
}
Â 
int main()
{
    constexpr std::simd<int> a = 1;
    println("a", a);
Â 
    constexpr std::simd<int> b([](int i) { return i - 2; });
    println("b", b);
Â 
    constexpr auto c = a + b;
    println("c", c);
Â 
    constexpr auto d = my_abs(c);
    println("d", d);
Â 
    constexpr auto e = d * d;
    println("e", e);
Â 
    constexpr auto inner_product = std::reduce(e);
    std::cout << "inner product: " << inner_product << '\n';
Â 
    constexpr std::simd<double, 16> x([](int i) { return i; });
    println("x", x);
    // overloaded math functions are defined in <simd>
    println("cosÂ²(x) + sinÂ²(x)", std::pow(std::cos(x), 2) + std::pow(std::sin(x), 2));
}

```

Output:

```
a: 1 1 1 1 
b: -2 -1 0 1 
c: -1 0 1 2 
d: 1 0 1 2 
e: 1 0 1 4 
inner product: 6
x: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 
cosÂ²(x) + sinÂ²(x): 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

```
