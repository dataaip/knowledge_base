A ****LegacyForwardIterator**** is a LegacyIterator that can read data from the pointed-to element.

Unlike LegacyInputIterator and LegacyOutputIterator, it can be used in multipass algorithms.

If a ****LegacyForwardIterator**** it originates from a Container, then it's value type is the same as the container's, so dereferencing (\*it) obtains the container's value type.

### Requirements

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `X` | A forward iterator type |
| `T` | The value type of `X` (i.e. std::iterator_traits<X>::value_type) |
| `Ref` | std::iterator_traits<X>::reference |
| Value | Definition |
| i, j | Values of type `X` or const X |
| r | A value of type `X&` |

`X` satisfies LegacyForwardIterator if all following conditions are satisfied:

- `X` satisfies LegacyInputIterator.
- `X` satisfies DefaultConstructible.
- If `X` is a mutable iterator, `Ref` is a reference to `T`.
- If `X` is a constant iterator, `Ref` is a reference to const T.
- Objects of the type `X` provide multi-pass guarantee.
- If i and j are equal, then either i and j are both dereferenceable or else neither is dereferenceable.
- If i and j are both dereferenceable, then i == j if and only if \*i and \*j are bound to the same object.
- The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects:

| Expression | Type | Effects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| r++ | convertible to const X& | Equivalent to X x = r; ++r; return x;. |
| \*i++ | `Ref` |  |

### Equality domain

The domain of == for forward iterators is that of iterators over the same underlying sequence.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| However, value-initialized forward iterators can be compared, and must compare equal to other value-initialized iterators of the same type.  In other words, value-initialized forward iterators behave as if they refer past the end of the same empty sequence. | (since C++14) |

### Multi-pass guarantee

Two dereferenceable iterators a and b of type `X` offer the **multi-pass guarantee** if all following conditions are satisfied:

- a == b implies ++a == ++b.
- Any of the following conditions is satisfied:

:   - `X` is a pointer type.
    - The expression (void)++X(a), \*a is equivalent to the expression \*a.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Concept For the definition of std::iterator_traits, the following exposition-only concept is defined.   |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | template<class It>  concept __LegacyForwardIterator =      __LegacyInputIterator<It> && std::constructible_from<It> &&      std::is_reference_v<std::iter_reference_t<It>> &&      std::same_as<          std::remove_cvref_t<std::iter_reference_t<It>>,          typename std::indirectly_readable_traits<It>::value_type> &&      requires(It it) {          {  it++ } -> std::convertible_to<const It&>;          { \*it++ } -> std::same_as<std::iter_reference_t<It>>; }; |  |  | |  |  |  |   where the exposition-only concept `__LegacyInputIterator<T>` is described in LegacyInputIterator. | (since C++20) |

### Notes

Unlike the std::forward_iterator concept, the LegacyForwardIterator requirements requires dereference to return a reference.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 1212 (N3066) | C++98 | the type of \*i++ did not match the type of \*i-- required by LegacyBidirectionalIterator | changed the type to `Ref` |
| LWG 1311 (N3066) | C++98 | “a == b implies ++a == ++b” alone did not offer multipass guarantee[[1]](ForwardIterator.html#cite_note-1) | also requires “a == b implies ++a != b”[[2]](ForwardIterator.html#cite_note-2) |
| LWG 3798 | C++20 | `__LegacyForwardIterator` required std::iter_reference_t<It> to be an lvalue reference type | also allows rvalue reference types |

1. ↑ In the scenario where a and b use the same underlying iterator, evaluating the expression ++a == ++b actually increments the underlying container twice, but the result is still true.
2. ↑ Formally also requires implying ++b != a.
