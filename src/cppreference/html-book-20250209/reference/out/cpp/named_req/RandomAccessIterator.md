A ****LegacyRandomAccessIterator**** is a LegacyBidirectionalIterator that can be moved to point to any element in constant time.

If a ****LegacyRandomAccessIterator**** it originates from a Container, then it's `value_type` is the same as the container's, so dereferencing (\*it) obtains the container's `value_type`.

A pointer to an element of an array satisfies all requirements of LegacyRandomAccessIterator.

### Requirements

The type `It` satisfies LegacyRandomAccessIterator if

- The type `It` satisfies LegacyBidirectionalIterator

And, given

- `value_type`, the type denoted by std::iterator_traits<It>::value_type
- `difference_type`, the type denoted by std::iterator_traits<It>::difference_type
- `reference`, the type denoted by std::iterator_traits<It>::reference
- i, a, b, objects of type `It` or const It
- r, an lvalue of type `It`
- n, an integer of type `difference_type`

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects:

| Expression | Return type | Operational semantics | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| r += n | `It&` | difference_type m = n;  if (m >= 0) while (m--) ++r;  else while (m++) --r;  return r; | - n can be both positive or negative - The complexity is constant (that is, the implementation cannot actually execute the while loop shown in operational semantics) |
| a + n n + a | `It` | It temp = a;  return temp += n; | - n can be both positive or negative - a + n == n + a |
| r -= n | `It&` | return r += -n; | The absolute value of n must be within the range of representable values of `difference_type`. |
| i - n | `It` | It temp = i;  return temp -= n; |  |
| b - a | `difference_type` | return n; (see the precondition) | Precondition:   - there exists a value n of type `difference_type` such that a + n == b   Postcondition:   - b == a + (b - a). |
| i[n] | convertible to `reference` | \*(i + n) |  |
| a < b | |  |  | | --- | --- | | meets BooleanTestable | (until C++20) | | models `boolean-testable` | (since C++20) | | Equivalent to return b - a > 0; | Precondition:  - same as of b - a   Strict total ordering relation:   - !(a < a) - if a < b then !(b < a) - if a < b and b < c then a < c - a < b or b < a or a == b  (exactly one of the expressions is true) |
| a > b | |  |  | | --- | --- | | meets BooleanTestable | (until C++20) | | models `boolean-testable` | (since C++20) | | b < a | Total ordering relation opposite to a < b |
| a >= b | |  |  | | --- | --- | | meets BooleanTestable | (until C++20) | | models `boolean-testable` | (since C++20) | | !(a < b) |  |
| a <= b | |  |  | | --- | --- | | meets BooleanTestable | (until C++20) | | models `boolean-testable` | (since C++20) | | !(a > b) |  |

The above rules imply that LegacyRandomAccessIterator also implements LessThanComparable.

A **mutable** LegacyRandomAccessIterator is a LegacyRandomAccessIterator that additionally satisfies the LegacyOutputIterator requirements.

| Concept For the definition of std::iterator_traits, the following exposition-only concept is defined.   |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | template<class I>  concept __LegacyRandomAccessIterator =  Â  Â  __LegacyBidirectionalIterator<I> && std::totally_ordered<I> &&  Â  Â  Â  Â  requires(I i, typename std::incrementable_traits<I>::difference_type n)  Â  Â  Â  Â  {  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  { i += n } -> std::same_as<I&>;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  { i -= n } -> std::same_as<I&>;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  { i + Â n } -> std::same_as<I>;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  { n + Â i } -> std::same_as<I>;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  { i - Â n } -> std::same_as<I>;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  { i - Â i } -> std::same_as<decltype(n)>;  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  { Â i[n] Â } -> std::convertible_to<std::iter_reference_t<I>>; }; |  |  | |  |  |  |   where the exposition-only concept `__LegacyBidirectionalIterator` is described in LegacyBidirectionalIterator. | (since C++20) |

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 299 (N3066) | C++98 | the return type of a[n] was required to be convertible to const value_type& | the return type is required to be convertible to `reference` |
| LWG 448 | C++98 | the return type of a[n] was required to be convertible to `value_type` | the return type is required to be convertible to const value_type&[[1]](RandomAccessIterator.html#cite_note-1) |
| LWG 1079 | C++98 | b - a was defined using a < b, resulted in circular definition | removed a < b from the definition |
| LWG 2114 (P2167R3) | C++98 | convertibility to bool was too weak to reflect the expectation of implementations | requirements strengthened |

1. â†‘ LWG issue 299 was reopened after this resolution.
