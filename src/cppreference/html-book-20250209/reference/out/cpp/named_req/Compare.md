****Compare**** is a set of requirements expected by some of the standard library facilities from the user-provided function object types.

The return value of the function call operation applied to an object of a type satisfying Compare, when converted to bool, yields true if the first argument of the call appears before the second in the strict weak ordering relation induced by this type, and false otherwise.

As with any BinaryPredicate, evaluation of that expression is not allowed to call non-const functions through the dereferenced iterators and, syntactically, the function call operation must accept const object arguments, with the same behavior regardless of whether the arguments are const or non-const.

### Requirements

The type `T` satisfies Compare if

- The type `T` satisfies BinaryPredicate, and

Given

- `comp`, an object of type `T`,
- equiv(a, b), an expression-equivalent to !comp(a, b) && !comp(b, a).

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects:

| Expression | Return type | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| comp(a, b) | |  |  | | --- | --- | | meets BooleanTestable | (until C++20) | | models **boolean-testable** | (since C++20) | | Establishes strict weak ordering relation with the following properties:  - For all `a`, comp(a, a) == false. - If comp(a, b) == true then comp(b, a) == false. - if comp(a, b) == true and comp(b, c) == true then comp(a, c) == true. |
| equiv(a, b) | bool | Establishes equivalence relationship with the following properties:  - For all `a`, equiv(a, a) == true. - If equiv(a, b) == true, then equiv(b, a) == true. - If equiv(a, b) == true and equiv(b, c) == true, then equiv(a, c) == true. |

Note: `comp` induces a strict total ordering on the equivalence classes determined by `equiv`.
