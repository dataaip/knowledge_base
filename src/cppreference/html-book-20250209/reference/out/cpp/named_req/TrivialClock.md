The ****TrivialClock**** requirements describe the requirements satisfied by several clocks in the chrono library.

### Requirements

For a type TC:

- The type must meet Clock requirements.
- The types TC::rep, TC::duration, and TC::time_point satisfy the requirements of EqualityComparable, LessThanComparable, DefaultConstructible, CopyConstructible, CopyAssignable, Destructible(until C++17), Swappable, and NumericType.
- The function TC::now() does not throw exceptions.
- The type TC::time_point::clock meets the TrivialClock requirements, recursively.

### Standard library

The following types in the standard library satisfy TrivialClock requirements:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| system_clock(C++11) | wall clock time from the system-wide realtime clock   (class) |
| steady_clock(C++11) | monotonic clock that will never be adjusted   (class) |
| high_resolution_clock(C++11) | the clock with the shortest tick period available   (class) |
| file_clock(C++20) | Clock used for file time   (typedef) |
| file_time_type(C++17) | represents file time values   (typedef) |
