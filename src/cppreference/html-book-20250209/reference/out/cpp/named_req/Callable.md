A ****Callable**** type is a type for which the **INVOKE** and **INVOKE<R>** operations (used by, e.g., std::function, std::bind, and std::thread::thread) are applicable.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `INVOKE` can be performed explicitly using the library function std::invoke. | (since C++17) |
| `INVOKE<R>` can be performed explicitly using the library function std::invoke_r. | (since C++23) |

### Requirements

The type `T` satisfies Callable if

Given

- `f`, an object of type `T`,
- `ArgTypes`, suitable list of argument types,
- `R`, suitable return type.

The following expressions must be valid:

| Expression | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| **INVOKE<R>**(f, std::declval<ArgTypes>()...) | The expression is well-formed in unevaluated context. |

### Notes

Pointers to data members are Callable, even though no function calls take place.

### Standard library

In addition, the following standard library facilities accept any Callable type (not just FunctionObject):

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| function(C++11) | copyable wrapper of any copy constructible callable object   (class template) |
| move_only_function(C++23) | move-only wrapper of any callable object that supports qualifiers in a given call signature   (class template) |
| copyable_function(C++26) | copyable wrapper of any copy constructible callable object that supports qualifiers in a given call signature   (class template) |
| function_ref(C++26) | non-owning wrapper of any callable object   (class template) |
| bind(C++11) | binds one or more arguments to a function object   (function template) |
| bind_frontbind_back(C++20)(C++23) | bind a variable number of arguments, in order, to a function object   (function template) |
| reference_wrapper(C++11) | CopyConstructible and CopyAssignable reference wrapper   (class template) |
| result_ofinvoke_result(C++11)(removed in C++20)(C++17) | deduces the result type of invoking a callable object with a set of arguments   (class template) |
| thread(C++11) | manages a separate thread   (class) |
| jthread(C++20) | std::thread with support for auto-joining and cancellation   (class) |
| call_once(C++11) | invokes a function only once even if called from multiple threads   (function template) |
| async(C++11) | runs a function asynchronously (potentially in a new thread) and returns a std::future that will hold the result   (function template) |
| packaged_task(C++11) | packages a function to store its return value for asynchronous retrieval   (class template) |

| is_invocableis_invocable_ris_nothrow_invocableis_nothrow_invocable_r(C++17) | checks if a type can be invoked (as if by std::invoke) with the given argument types   (class template) |
| invocableregular_invocable(C++20) | specifies that a callable type can be invoked with a given set of argument types   (concept) |
| invokeinvoke_r(C++17)(C++23) | invokes any ****Callable**** object with given arguments and possibility to specify return type(since C++23)   (function template) |
