    using const_iterator  = const E*;
 
    constexpr initializer_list() noexcept;
 
    constexpr size_t size() const noexcept;     // number of elements
    constexpr const E* begin() const noexcept;  // first element
    constexpr const E* end() const noexcept;    // one past the last element
  };
 
  // initializer list range access
  template<class E> constexpr const E* begin(initializer_list<E> il) noexcept;
