This header was originally in the C standard library as <stdarg.h>.

This header provides support for C-style variadic functions, while the C definition of "default argument promotions" is replaced with the C++ definition.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Types | |
| va_list | holds the information needed by va_start, va_arg, va_end, and va_copy   (typedef) |
| Macros | |
| va_start | enables access to variadic function arguments   (function macro) |
| va_arg | accesses the next variadic function argument   (function macro) |
| va_copy(C++11) | makes a copy of the variadic function arguments   (function macro) |
| va_end | ends traversal of the variadic function arguments   (function macro) |

### Synopsis

```
namespace std {
  using va_list = /*see description*/ ;
}
#define va_arg(V, P) /*see description*/
#define va_copy(VDST, VSRC) /*see description*/
#define va_end(V) /*see description*/
#define va_start(V, P) /*see description*/

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CWG 2645 | C++98 | C++ defines "default argument promotions", but its C definition was used | the C++ definition overrides the C definition |
