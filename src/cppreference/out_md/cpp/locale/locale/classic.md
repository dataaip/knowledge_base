| static const locale& classic(); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Obtains a reference to the C++ locale that implements the classic "C" locale semantics. This locale, unlike the global locale, cannot be altered.

### Parameters

none

### Return value

Returns a reference to the "C" locale.

### Notes

Some of the standard-required facets, such as the UTF-8/UTF-32 conversion facet std::codecvt<char32_t, char, std::mbstate_t>, have no equivalents in the "C" locale, but they are nevertheless present in the locale returned by std::locale::classic(), as in any other locale constructed in a C++ program.
