| public:  CharT decimal_point() const; | (1) |  |
| protected:  virtual CharT do_decimal_point() const; | (2) |  |
|  |  |  |

1) Public member function, calls the member function `do_decimal_point` of the most derived class.2) Returns the character to use as the decimal point separator in monetary I/O if the format uses fractions (that is, if do_frac_digits() is greater than zero). For typical U.S. locales, it is the character '.' (or L'.').

### Return value

The object of type `CharT` holding the decimal point character.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
void show_dpt(const char* locname)
{
    std::locale loc(locname);
    std::cout.imbue(loc);
    std::cout << locname << " decimal point is '"
              << std::use_facet<std::moneypunct<char>>(loc).decimal_point()
              << "' for example: " << std::showbase << std::put_money(123);
    if (std::use_facet<std::moneypunct<char>>(loc).frac_digits() == 0)
        std::cout << " (does not use frac digits)";
 
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    show_dpt("en_US.utf8");
    show_dpt("ja_JP.utf8");
    show_dpt("sv_SE.utf8");
    show_dpt("de_DE.utf8");
}

```

Output:

```
en_US.utf8 decimal point is '.' for example: $1.23
ja_JP.utf8 decimal point is '.' for example: ￥123 (does not use frac digits)
sv_SE.utf8 decimal point is ',' for example: 1,23 kr
de_DE.utf8 decimal point is ',' for example: 1,23 €

```
