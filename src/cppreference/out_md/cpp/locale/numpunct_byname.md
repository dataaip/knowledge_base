|  |  |  |

`std::numpunct_byname` is a std::numpunct facet which encapsulates numeric punctuation preferences of a locale specified at its construction.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<locale>` | |
| std::numpunct_byname<char> | locale-specific std::numpunct facet for narrow character I/O |
| std::numpunct_byname<wchar_t> | locale-specific std::numpunct facet for wide character I/O |

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `char_type` | `CharT` |
| `string_type` | std::basic_string<CharT> |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ****(constructor)**** | constructs a new `numpunct_byname` facet   (public member function) |
| ****(destructor)**** | destroys a `numpunct_byname` facet   (protected member function) |

## std::numpunct_byname::numpunct_byname

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| explicit numpunct_byname( const char\* name, std::size_t refs = 0 ); |  |  |
| explicit numpunct_byname( const std::string& name, std::size_t refs = 0 ); |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Constructs a new `std::numpunct_byname` facet for a locale with name.

refs is used for resource management: if refs == 0, the implementation destroys the facet, when the last std::locale object holding it is destroyed. Otherwise, the object is not destroyed.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | - | the name of the locale |
| refs | - | the number of references that link to the facet |

## std::numpunct_byname::~numpunct_byname

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| protected:  ~numpunct_byname(); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Destroys the facet.

## Inherited from std::numpunct

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `char_type` | `CharT` |
| `string_type` | std::basic_string<CharT> |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member | Description |
| std::locale::id `id` [static] | the identifier of the facet |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| decimal_point | invokes `do_decimal_point`   (public member function of `std::numpunct<CharT>`) |
| thousands_sep | invokes `do_thousands_sep`   (public member function of `std::numpunct<CharT>`) |
| grouping | invokes `do_grouping`   (public member function of `std::numpunct<CharT>`) |
| truenamefalsename | invokes `do_truename` or `do_falsename`   (public member function of `std::numpunct<CharT>`) |

### Protected member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| do_decimal_point[virtual] | provides the character to use as decimal point   (virtual protected member function of `std::numpunct<CharT>`) |
| do_thousands_sep[virtual] | provides the character to use as thousands separator   (virtual protected member function of `std::numpunct<CharT>`) |
| do_grouping[virtual] | provides the numbers of digits between each pair of thousands separators   (virtual protected member function of `std::numpunct<CharT>`) |
| do_truenamedo_falsename[virtual] | provides the string to use as the name of the boolean true and false   (virtual protected member function of `std::numpunct<CharT>`) |

### Example

This example demonstrates how to apply numeric punctuation rules of another language without changing the rest of the locale.

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
Â 
int main()
{
    const double number = 1000.25;
    std::wcout << L"default locale: " << number << L'\n';
    std::wcout.imbue(std::locale(std::wcout.getloc(),
                                 new std::numpunct_byname<wchar_t>("ru_RU.UTF8")));
    std::wcout << L"default locale with russian numpunct: " << number << L'\n';
}

```

Output:

```
default locale: 1000.25
default locale with russian numpunct: 1 000,25

```
