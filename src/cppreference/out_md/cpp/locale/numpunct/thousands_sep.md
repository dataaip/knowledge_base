1) Public member function, calls the member function `do_thousands_sep` of the most derived class.2) Returns the character to be used as the separator between digit groups when parsing or formatting integers and integral parts of floating-point values.

### Return value

The object of type `char_type` to use as the thousands separator. The standard specializations of `std::numpunct` return ',' and L','.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
struct space_out : std::numpunct<char>
{
    char do_thousands_sep()   const { return ' '; }  // separate with spaces
    std::string do_grouping() const { return "\1"; } // groups of 1 digit
};
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "default locale: " << 12345678 << '\n';
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale(std::cout.getloc(), new space_out));
    std::cout << "locale with modified numpunct: " << 12345678 << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
default locale: 12345678
locale with modified numpunct: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

```
