The facet `std::moneypunct` encapsulates monetary value format preferences. Stream I/O manipulators std::get_money and std::put_money use `std::moneypunct` through std::money_get and std::money_put for parsing monetary value input and formatting monetary value output.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<locale>` | |
| std::moneypunct<char> | provides equivalents of the "C" locale preferences |
| std::moneypunct<wchar_t> | provides wide character equivalents of the "C" locale preferences |
| std::moneypunct<char, true> | provides equivalents of the "C" locale preferences, with international currency symbols |
| std::moneypunct<wchar_t, true> | provides wide character equivalents of the "C" locale preferences, with international currency symbols |

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `char_type` | `CharT` |
| `string_type` | std::basic_string<CharT> |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member | Description |
| std::locale::id `id` [static] | the identifier of the facet |
| const bool `intl` [static] | International |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a new `moneypunct` facet   (public member function) |
| decimal_point | invokes `do_decimal_point`   (public member function) |
| thousands_sep | invokes `do_thousands_sep`   (public member function) |
| grouping | invokes `do_grouping`   (public member function) |
| curr_symbol | invokes `do_curr_symbol`   (public member function) |

| frac_digits | invokes `do_frac_digits`   (public member function) |
| pos_formatneg_format | invokes `do_pos_format`/`do_neg_format`   (public member function) |

### Protected member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (destructor) | destructs a `moneypunct` facet   (protected member function) |
| do_decimal_point[virtual] | provides the character to use as decimal point   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_thousands_sep[virtual] | provides the character to use as thousands separator   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_grouping[virtual] | provides the numbers of digits between each pair of thousands separators   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_curr_symbol[virtual] | provides the string to use as the currency identifier   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_positive_signdo_negative_sign[virtual] | provides the string to indicate a positive or negative value   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_frac_digits[virtual] | provides the number of digits to display after the decimal point   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_pos_formatdo_neg_format[virtual] | provides the formatting pattern for currency values   (virtual protected member function) |

## Inherited from std::money_base

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| enum part { none, space, symbol, sign, value }; | unscoped enumeration type |
| struct pattern { char field[4]; }; | the monetary format type |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Enumeration constant | Description |
| `none` | whitespace is permitted but not required except in the last position, where whitespace is not permitted |
| `space` | one or more whitespace characters are required |
| `symbol` | the sequence of characters returned by std::moneypunct::curr_symbol is required |
| `sign` | the first of the characters returned by std::moneypunct::positive_sign or std::moneypunct::negative_sign is required |
| `value` | the absolute numeric monetary value is required |
