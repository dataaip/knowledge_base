1) Returns the pointer to the underlying byte stream.2) Replaces the associated byte stream with bytebuf.

### Return value

1) `bufptr`2) the previous value of `bufptr`

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <codecvt>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <sstream>
¬†
int main()
{
    // Convert UTF-8 to UCS4
    std::stringbuf utf8buf("z\u00df\u6c34\U0001d10b");
                       // or "\x7a\xc3\x9f\xe6\xb0\xb4\xf0\x9d\x84\x8b"
                       // or u8"z√üÊ∞¥ùÑã"
    std::wbuffer_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>> conv(&utf8buf);
    std::wistream ucsbuf(&conv);
    std::cout << "Reading from a UTF-8 stringbuf via wbuffer_convert: "
              << std::hex << std::showbase;
    for (wchar_t c; ucsbuf.get(c);)
        std::cout << static_cast<std::wint_t>(c) << ' ';
¬†
    // Reuse the same wbuffer_convert to handle UCS4 to UTF-8 output
    conv.rdbuf(std::cout.rdbuf());
    std::wostream out(&conv);
    std::cout << "\nSending UCS4 data to std::cout via wbuffer_convert: ";
    out << L"z\u00df\u6c34\U0001d10b\n";
}

```

Output:

```
Reading from a UTF-8 stringbuf via wbuffer_convert: 0x7a 0xdf 0x6c34 0x1d10b 
Sending UCS4 data to std::cout via wbuffer_convert: z√üÊ∞¥ùÑã

```
