1) Public member function, calls the member function `do_always_noconv` of the most derived class.2) Returns true if both do_in() and do_out() return `std::codecvt_base::noconv` for all valid inputs.

### Return value

true if this conversion facet performs no conversions, false otherwise.

The non-converting specialization std::codecvt<char, char, std::mbstate_t> returns true.

### Notes

This function may be used e.g. in the implementation of std::basic_filebuf::underflow and std::basic_filebuf::overflow to use bulk character copy instead of calling std::codecvt::in or std::codecvt::out if it is known that the locale imbued in the std::basic_filebuf does not perform any conversions.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "The non-converting char<->char codecvt::always_noconv() returns " 
              << std::boolalpha
              << std::use_facet<std::codecvt<char, char, std::mbstate_t>>(
                    std::locale()
                 ).always_noconv() << '\n'
              << "while wchar_t<->char codecvt::always_noconv() returns "
              << std::use_facet<std::codecvt<wchar_t, char, std::mbstate_t>>(
                    std::locale()
                 ).always_noconv() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
The non-converting char<->char codecvt::always_noconv() returns true
while wchar_t<->char codecvt::always_noconv() returns false

```
