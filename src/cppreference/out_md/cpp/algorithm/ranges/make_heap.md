|  |  |  |

Constructs a heap with respect to comp and proj from the elements in the specified range.

1) The specified range is ``first`,`last`)`.2) The specified range is r.

The function-like entities described on this page are [**algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the iterator and sentinel designating the range of elements to modify |
| r | - | the range of elements to modify |
| comp | - | comparator to apply to the projected elements |
| proj | - | projection to apply to the elements |

### Return value

1) last2) ranges::end(r)

### Complexity

At most \(\scriptsize 3\cdot N\)3·N applications of comp and \(\scriptsize 6\cdot N\)6·N applications of proj, where \(\scriptsize N \)N is:

1) ranges::distance(first, last)2) ranges::distance(r)

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 
void out(const auto& what, int n = 1)
{
    while (n-- > 0)
        std::cout << what;
}
 
void print(auto rem, const auto& v)
{
    out(rem);
    for (auto e : v)
        out(e), out(' ');
    out('\n');
}
 
void draw_heap(const auto& v)
{
    auto bails = [](int n, int w)
    {
        auto b = [](int w) { out("┌"), out("─", w), out("┴"), out("─", w), out("┐"); };
        if (!(n /= 2))
            return;
        for (out(' ', w); n-- > 0;)
            b(w), out(' ', w + w + 1);
        out('\n');
    };
 
    auto data = [](int n, int w, auto& first, auto last)
    {
        for (out(' ', w); n-- > 0 && first != last; ++first)
            out(*first), out(' ', w + w + 1);
        out('\n');
    };
 
    auto tier = &
    {
        const int n{1 << t};
        const int w{(1 << (m - t - 1)) - 1};
        bails(n, w), data(n, w, first, last);
    };
 
    const int m{static_cast<int>(std::ceil(std::log2(1 + v.size())))};
    auto first{v.cbegin()};
    for (int i{}; i != m; ++i)
        tier(i, m, first, v.cend());
}
 
int main()
{
    std::vector h{1, 6, 1, 8, 0, 3, 3, 9, 8, 8, 7, 4, 9, 8, 9};
    print("source: ", h);
 
    std::ranges::make_heap(h);
    print("\n" "max-heap: ", h);
    draw_heap(h);
 
    std::ranges::make_heap(h, std::greater{});
    print("\n" "min-heap: ", h);
    draw_heap(h);
}

```

Output:

```

source: 1 6 1 8 0 3 3 9 8 8 7 4 9 8 9
 
max-heap: 9 8 9 8 8 4 9 6 1 0 7 1 3 8 3
