| Defined in header `<stop_token>` |  |  |
| class never_stop_token; |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

The `never_stop_token` class models `unstoppable_token` that provides static information that a stop is never possible nor requested. It is the default stop token type returned by `std::get_stop_token` if no other associated stop token is being provided in the queryable object.

### Member alias templates

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| callback_type<Callback> | /\*callback-type\*/ where the type is defined as:  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | struct /\*callback-type\*/  {  Â  Â  explicit /\*callback-type\*/( never_stop_token,  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  auto&& ) noexcept {} }; |  | (exposition only\*) | |  |  |  | |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| stop_requested[static] | indicates that a stop can never be requested   (public static member function) |
| stop_possible[static] | indicates that a stop is not possible   (public static member function) |
| operator== | compares two `never_stop_token` objects   (public member function) |

## std::never_stop_token::stop_requested

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| static constexpr bool stop_requested() noexcept { return false; } |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Always returns false, indicating that a stop can never be requested.

## std::never_stop_token::stop_possible

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| static constexpr bool stop_possible() noexcept { return false; } |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Always returns false, indicating that a stop is not possible.

## std::never_stop_token::operator==

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bool operator==(const never_stop_token&) const = default; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Two `never_stop_token` objects always compare equal.
