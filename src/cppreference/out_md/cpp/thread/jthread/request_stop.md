| bool request_stop() noexcept; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Issues a stop request to the internal stop-state, if it has not yet already had stop requested.

The determination is made atomically, and if stop was requested, the stop-state is atomically updated to avoid race conditions, such that:

- stop_requested() and stop_possible() can be concurrently invoked on other std::stop_tokens and std::stop_sources of the same shared stop-state.
- request_stop() can be concurrently invoked from multiple threads on the same `jthread` object or on other std::stop_source objects associated with the same stop-state, and only one will actually perform the stop request.

However, see the Notes section.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if this invocation made a stop request, otherwise false.

### Postconditions

For a std::stop_token retrieved by get_stop_token() or a std::stop_source retrieved by get_stop_source(), stop_requested() is true.

### Notes

If the request_stop() does issue a stop request (i.e., returns true), then any std::stop_callbacks registered for the same associated stop-state will be invoked synchronously, on the same thread request_stop() is issued on. If an invocation of a callback exits via an exception, std::terminate is called.

If a stop request has already been made, this function returns false. However there is no guarantee that another thread or std::stop_source object which has just (successfully) requested stop for the same stop-state is not still in the middle of invoking a std::stop_callback function.

If the request_stop() does issue a stop request (i.e., returns true), then all condition variables of base type std::condition_variable_any registered with an interruptible wait for std::stop_tokens associated with the `jthread`'s internal stop-state will be awoken.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
 
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
// Helper function to quickly show which thread printed what
void print(auto txt)
{
    std::cout << std::this_thread::get_id() << ' ' << txt;
}
 
int main()
{
    // A sleepy worker thread
    std::jthread sleepy_worker(
        [](std::stop_token stoken)
        {
            for (int i = 10; i; --i)
            {
                std::this_thread::sleep_for(300ms);
                if (stoken.stop_requested())
                {
                    print("Sleepy worker is requested to stop\n");
                    return;
                }
                print("Sleepy worker goes back to sleep\n");
            }
        });
 
    // A waiting worker thread
    // The condition variable will be awoken by the stop request.
    std::jthread waiting_worker(
        [](std::stop_token stoken)
        {
            std::mutex mutex;
            std::unique_lock lock(mutex);
            std::condition_variable_any().wait(lock, stoken, []{ return false; });
            print("Waiting worker is requested to stop\n");
            return;
        });
 
    // Sleep this thread to give threads time to spin
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(400ms);
 
    // std::jthread::request_stop() can be called explicitly:
    print("Requesting stop of sleepy worker\n");
    sleepy_worker.request_stop();
    sleepy_worker.join();
    print("Sleepy worker joined\n");
 
    // Or automatically using RAII:
    // waiting_worker's destructor will call request_stop()
    // and join the thread automatically.
}

```

Possible output:

```
140287602706176 Sleepy worker goes back to sleep
140287623300928 Requesting stop of sleepy worker
140287602706176 Sleepy worker is requested to stop
140287623300928 Sleepy worker joined
140287594313472 Waiting worker is requested to stop
