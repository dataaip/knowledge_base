****std::stop_source****

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Member functions | | | | |
| stop_source::stop_source | | | | |
| stop_source::~stop_source | | | | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<stop_token>` |  |  |
| class stop_source; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The `stop_source` class provides the means to issue a stop request, such as for std::jthread cancellation. A stop request made for one `stop_source` object is visible to all `stop_source`s and std::stop_tokens of the same associated stop-state; any std::stop_callback(s) registered for associated std::stop_token(s) will be invoked, and any std::condition_variable_any objects waiting on associated std::stop_token(s) will be awoken.

Once a stop is requested, it cannot be withdrawn. Additional stop requests have no effect.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs new `stop_source` object   (public member function) |
| (destructor) | destructs the `stop_source` object   (public member function) |
| operator= | assigns the `stop_source` object   (public member function) |
| Modifiers | |
| request_stop | makes a stop request for the associated stop-state, if any   (public member function) |
| swap | swaps two `stop_source` objects   (public member function) |
| Observers | |
| get_token | returns a `stop_token` for the associated stop-state   (public member function) |
| stop_requested | checks whether the associated stop-state has been requested to stop   (public member function) |
| stop_possible | checks whether associated stop-state can be requested to stop   (public member function) |

### Non-member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator==(C++20) | compares two `std::stop_source` objects   (function) |
| swap(std::stop_source)(C++20) | specializes the std::swap algorithm   (function) |

### Helper tags

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| nostopstatenostopstate_t(C++20) | a tag used for `stop_source` to indicate no associated stop-state upon construction (tag) |

### Notes

For the purposes of std::jthread cancellation the `stop_source` object should be retrieved from the std::jthread object using get_stop_source(); or stop should be requested directly from the std::jthread object using request_stop(). This will then use the same associated stop-state as that passed into the std::jthread's invoked function argument (i.e., the function being executed on its thread).

For other uses, however, a `stop_source` can be constructed separately using the default constructor, which creates new stop-state.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_jthread` | `201911L` | (C++20) | Stop token and joining thread |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <stop_token>
#include <thread>
Â 
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
Â 
void worker_fun(int id, std::stop_token stoken)
{ 
    for (int i = 10; i; --i)
    {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(300ms);
        if (stoken.stop_requested())
        {
            std::printf("  worker%d is requested to stop\n", id);
            return;
        }
        std::printf("  worker%d goes back to sleep\n", id);
    }
}
Â 
int main()
{
    std::jthread threads[4];
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    auto print = [](const std::stop_source& source)
    {
        std::printf("stop_source stop_possible =Â %s, stop_requested =Â %s\n",
                    source.stop_possible() ? "true" : "false",
                    source.stop_requested() ? "true" : "false");
    };
Â 
    // Common source
    std::stop_source stop_source;
Â 
    print(stop_source);
Â 
    // Create worker threads
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
        threads[i] = std::jthread(worker_fun, i + 1, stop_source.get_token());
Â 
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(500ms);
Â 
    std::puts("Request stop");
    stop_source.request_stop();
Â 
    print(stop_source);
Â 
    // Note: destructor of jthreads will call join so no need for explicit calls
}

```

Possible output:

```
stop_source stop_possible = true, stop_requested = false
  worker2 goes back to sleep
  worker3 goes back to sleep
  worker1 goes back to sleep
  worker4 goes back to sleep
Request stop
stop_source stop_possible = true, stop_requested = true
  worker3 is requested to stop
  worker1 is requested to stop
  worker2 is requested to stop
  worker4 is requested to stop

```
