| Defined in header `<filesystem>` |  |  |
| bool status_known( std::filesystem::file_status s ) noexcept; | (1) | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Checks if the given file status is known, equivalent to s.type() != file_type::none.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| s | - | file status to check |

### Return value

true if the given file status is a known file status.

### Notes

Despite the name, the function checks for the file status of file_type::none (meaning an error occurred), not file_type::unknown (meaning file exists, but its type cannot be determined).
