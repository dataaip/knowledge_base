The floating-point environment is the set of floating-point status flags and control modes supported by the implementation. It is thread-local. Each thread inherits the initial state of its floating-point environment from the parent thread. Floating-point operations modify the floating-point status flags to indicate abnormal results or auxiliary information. The state of floating-point control modes affects the outcomes of some floating-point operations.

The floating-point environment access and modification is only meaningful when #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS is supported and is set to `ON`. Otherwise the implementation is free to assume that floating-point control modes are always the default ones and that floating-point status flags are never tested or modified. In practice, few current compilers, such as HP aCC, Oracle Studio, or IBM XL, support the `#pragma` explicitly, but most compilers allow meaningful access to the floating-point environment anyway.

### Types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<cfenv>` | |
| fenv_t(C++11) | the type representing the entire floating-point environment   (typedef) |
| fexcept_t(C++11) | the type representing all floating-point status flags collectively   (typedef) |

### Functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| feclearexcept(C++11) | clears the specified floating-point status flags   (function) |
| fetestexcept(C++11) | determines which of the specified floating-point status flags are set   (function) |
| feraiseexcept(C++11) | raises the specified floating-point exceptions   (function) |
| fegetexceptflagfesetexceptflag(C++11)(C++11) | copies the state of the specified floating-point status flags from or to the floating-point environment   (function) |
| fegetroundfesetround(C++11)(C++11) | gets or sets rounding direction   (function) |
| fegetenvfesetenv(C++11) | saves or restores the current floating-point environment   (function) |
| feholdexcept(C++11) | saves the environment, clears all status flags and ignores all future errors   (function) |
| feupdateenv(C++11) | restores the floating-point environment and raises the previously raised exceptions   (function) |

### Macros

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| FE_ALL_EXCEPTFE_DIVBYZEROFE_INEXACTFE_INVALIDFE_OVERFLOWFE_UNDERFLOW(C++11) | floating-point exceptions   (macro constant) |
| FE_DOWNWARDFE_TONEARESTFE_TOWARDZEROFE_UPWARD(C++11) | floating-point rounding direction   (macro constant) |
| FE_DFL_ENV(C++11) | default floating-point environment   (macro constant) |

### Notes

The floating-point exceptions are not related to the C++ exceptions. When a floating-point operation raises a floating-point exception, the status of the floating-point environment changes, which can be tested with std::fetestexcept, but the execution of a C++ program on most implementations continues uninterrupted.

There are compiler extensions that may be used to generate C++ exceptions automatically whenever a floating-point exception is raised:

- GNU libc function `feenableexcept()` enables trapping of the floating-point exceptions, which generates the signal `SIGFPE`. If the compiler option `-fnon-call-exceptions` was used, the handler for that signal may throw a user-defined C++ exception.
- MSVC function `_control87()` enables trapping of the floating-point exceptions, which generates a hardware exception, which can be converted to C++ exceptions with `_set_se_translator`.
