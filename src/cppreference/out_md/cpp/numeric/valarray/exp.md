| Defined in header `<valarray>` |  |  |
| template< class T >  valarray<T> exp( const valarray<T>& va ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

For each element in va computes **e** raised to the power equal to the value of the element.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| va | - | value array to apply the operation to |

### Return value

Value array containing **e** raised by the values in va.

### Notes

Unqualified function (exp) is used to perform the computation. If such function is not available, std::exp is used due to argument-dependent lookup.

The function can be implemented with the return type different from std::valarray. In this case, the replacement type has the following properties:

:   - All const member functions of std::valarray are provided.
    - std::valarray, std::slice_array, std::gslice_array, std::mask_array and std::indirect_array can be constructed from the replacement type.
    - For every function taking a const std::valarray<T>& except begin() and end()(since C++11), identical functions taking the replacement types shall be added;
    - For every function taking two const std::valarray<T>& arguments, identical functions taking every combination of const std::valarray<T>& and replacement types shall be added.
    - The return type does not add more than two levels of template nesting over the most deeply-nested argument type.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class T> valarray<T> exp(const valarray<T>& va) {     valarray<T> other = va;     for (T& i : other)         i = exp(i);       return other; // proxy object may be returned } ``` |

### Example

This example demonstrates the Euler's identity eiπ  
 = -1 and the related exponents.

Run this code

```
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
#include <numbers>
#include <valarray>
 
int main()
{
    const double pi = std::numbers::pi;
    std::valarray<std::complex<double>> v =
    {
        {0, 0}, {0, pi / 2}, {0, pi}, {0, 3 * pi / 2}, {0, 2 * pi}
    };
    std::valarray<std::complex<double>> v2 = std::exp(v);
    for (std::cout << std::showpos << std::fixed; auto n : v2)
        std::cout << n << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
(+1.000000,+0.000000)
(+0.000000,+1.000000)
(-1.000000,+0.000000)
(-0.000000,-1.000000)
(+1.000000,-0.000000)

```
