| T sum() const; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Computes the sum of the elements.

The function can be used only if operator+= is defined for type `T`. If the `std::valarray` is empty, the behavior is undefined. The order in which the elements are processed by this function is unspecified.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The sum of the elements.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <valarray>
 
int main()
{
    std::valarray<int> a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    std::cout << a.sum() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
55

```
