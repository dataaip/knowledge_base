| valarray<T> apply( T func(T) ) const; |  |  |
| valarray<T> apply( T func(const T&) ) const; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns a new valarray of the same size with values which are acquired by applying function `func` to the previous values of the elements.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| func | - | function to apply to the values |

### Return value

The resulting valarray with values acquired by applying function `func`.

### Notes

The function can be implemented with the return type different from std::valarray. In this case, the replacement type has the following properties:

:   - All const member functions of std::valarray are provided.
    - std::valarray, std::slice_array, std::gslice_array, std::mask_array and std::indirect_array can be constructed from the replacement type.
    - For every function taking a const std::valarray<T>& except begin() and end()(since C++11), identical functions taking the replacement types shall be added;
    - For every function taking two const std::valarray<T>& arguments, identical functions taking every combination of const std::valarray<T>& and replacement types shall be added.
    - The return type does not add more than two levels of template nesting over the most deeply-nested argument type.

### Possible implementation

Following straightforward implementations can be replaced by expression templates for a higher efficiency.

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class T> valarray<T> valarray<T>::apply(T func(T)) const {     valarray<T> other = *this;     for (T& i : other)         i = func(i);     return other; }   template<class T> valarray<T> valarray<T>::apply(T func(const T&)) const {     valarray<T> other = *this;     for (T& i : other)         i = func(i);     return other; } ``` |

### Example

Calculates and prints the first 10 factorials.

Run this code

```
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <valarray>
 
int main()
{
    std::valarray<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    v = v.apply([](int n) -> int
                {
                    return std::round(std::tgamma(n + 1));
                });
    for (auto n : v)
        std::cout << n << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
1 2 6 24 120 720 5040 40320 362880 3628800

```
