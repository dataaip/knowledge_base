| template< class T >  constexpr int countr_zero( T x ) noexcept; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the number of consecutive ​0​ bits in the value of x, starting from the least significant bit ("right").

This overload participates in overload resolution only if `T` is an unsigned integer type (that is, unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long, unsigned long long, or an extended unsigned integer type).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | - | value of unsigned integer type |

### Return value

The number of consecutive ​0​ bits in the value of x, starting from the least significant bit.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <bit>
#include <bitset>
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    for (const std::uint8_t i : {0, 0b11111111, 0b00011100, 0b00011101})
        std::cout << "countr_zero( " << std::bitset<8>(i) << " ) = "
                  << std::countr_zero(i) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
countr_zero( 00000000 ) = 8
countr_zero( 11111111 ) = 0
countr_zero( 00011100 ) = 2
countr_zero( 00011101 ) = 0

```
