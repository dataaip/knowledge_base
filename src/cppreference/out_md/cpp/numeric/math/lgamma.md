1-3) Computes the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the gamma function of num. The library provides overloads of `std::lgamma` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter.(since C++23)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| S) The SIMD overload performs an element-wise `std::lgamma` on v_num. (See **math-floating-point** and **deduced-simd-t** for their definitions.) | (since C++26) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double. | (since C++11) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| num | - | floating-point or integer value |

### Return value

If no errors occur, the value of the logarithm of the gamma function of num, that is \(\log_{e}|{\int_0^\infty t^{num-1} e^{-t} \mathsf{d}t}|\)loge|∫∞  
0**t**num-1  
 **e**-t d**t**|, is returned.

If a pole error occurs, +HUGE_VAL, `+HUGE_VALF`, or `+HUGE_VALL` is returned.

If a range error due to overflow occurs, ±HUGE_VAL, `±HUGE_VALF`, or `±HUGE_VALL` is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

If num is zero or is an integer less than zero, a pole error may occur.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If the argument is 1, +0 is returned.
- If the argument is 2, +0 is returned.
- If the argument is ±0, +∞ is returned and FE_DIVBYZERO is raised.
- If the argument is a negative integer, +∞ is returned and FE_DIVBYZERO is raised.
- If the argument is ±∞, +∞ is returned.
- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

If num is a natural number, std::lgamma(num) is the logarithm of the factorial of num - 1.

The POSIX version of `lgamma` is not thread-safe: each execution of the function stores the sign of the gamma function of num in the static external variable `signgam`. Some implementations provide `lgamma_r`, which takes a pointer to user-provided storage for `singgam` as the second parameter, and is thread-safe.

There is a non-standard function named `gamma` in various implementations, but its definition is inconsistent. For example, glibc and 4.2BSD version of `gamma` executes `lgamma`, but 4.4BSD version of `gamma` executes `tgamma`.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::lgamma(num) has the same effect as std::lgamma(static_cast<double>(num)).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cerrno>
#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
 
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 
const double pi = std::acos(-1); // or std::numbers::pi since C++20
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "lgamma(10) = " << std::lgamma(10)
              << ", log(9!) = " << std::log(std::tgamma(10))
              << ", exp(lgamma(10)) = " << std::exp(std::lgamma(10)) << '\n'
              << "lgamma(0.5) = " << std::lgamma(0.5)
              << ", log(sqrt(pi)) = " << std::log(std::sqrt(pi)) << '\n';
 
    // special values
    std::cout << "lgamma(1) = " << std::lgamma(1) << '\n'
              << "lgamma(+Inf) = " << std::lgamma(INFINITY) << '\n';
 
    // error handling
    errno = 0;
    std::feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
 
    std::cout << "lgamma(0) = " << std::lgamma(0) << '\n';
 
    if (errno == ERANGE)
        std::cout << "    errno == ERANGE: " << std::strerror(errno) << '\n';
    if (std::fetestexcept(FE_DIVBYZERO))
        std::cout << "    FE_DIVBYZERO raised\n";
}

```

Output:

```
lgamma(10) = 12.8018, log(9!) = 12.8018, exp(lgamma(10)) = 362880
lgamma(0.5) = 0.572365, log(sqrt(pi)) = 0.572365
lgamma(1) = 0
lgamma(+Inf) = inf
lgamma(0) = inf
    errno == ERANGE: Numerical result out of range
    FE_DIVBYZERO raised

```
