|  |  |  |

Obtain a value of type `To` by reinterpreting the object representation of `From`. Every bit in the value representation of the returned `To` object is equal to the corresponding bit in the object representation of from. The values of padding bits in the returned `To` object are unspecified.

If there is no value of type `To` corresponding to the value representation produced, the behavior is undefined. If there are multiple such values, which value is produced is unspecified.

A bit in the value representation of the result is **indeterminate** if it

- does not correspond to a bit in the value representation of `From` (i.e. it corresponds to a padding bit), or
- corresponds to a bit of an object that(until C++26)for which the smallest enclosing object(since C++26) is not within its lifetime, or
- has an indeterminate value.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| A bit in the value representation of the result is **erroneous** if it corresponds to a bit for which the smallest enclosing object has an erroneous value. | (since C++26) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| For each bit in the value representation of the result that is indeterminate, the smallest object containing that bit has an indeterminate value; the behavior is undefined unless that object is of an uninitialized-friendly type.  The result does not otherwise contain any indeterminate values. | (until C++26) |
| For each bit b in the value representation of the result that is indeterminate or erroneous, let u be the smallest object enclosing b:   - If u is of uninitialized-friendly type, u has an indeterminate value if any of the bits in its value representation are indeterminate, or otherwise has an erroneous value. - Otherwise, if b is indeterminate, the behavior is undefined. - Otherwise, the behavior is erroneous, and the result is as specified above. | (since C++26) |

The result does not otherwise contain any indeterminate or erroneous values.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if sizeof(To) == sizeof(From) and both `To` and `From` are TriviallyCopyable types.

This function template is constexpr if and only if each of `To`, `From` and the types of all subobjects of `To` and `From`:

- is not a union type;
- is not a pointer type;
- is not a pointer to member type;
- is not a volatile-qualified type; and
- has no non-static data member of reference type.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| from | - | the source of bits for the return value |

### Return value

An object of type `To` whose value representation is as described above.

### Possible implementation

To implement `std::bit_cast`, ignoring the fact that it's constexpr, std::memcpy can be used, when it is needed, to interpret the object representation as one of another type:

```
template<class To, class From>
std::enable_if_t<
    sizeof(To) == sizeof(From) &&
    std::is_trivially_copyable_v<From> &&
    std::is_trivially_copyable_v<To>,
    To>
// constexpr support needs compiler magic
bit_cast(const From& src) noexcept
{
    static_assert(std::is_trivially_constructible_v<To>,
        "This implementation additionally requires "
        "destination type to be trivially constructible");
Â 
    To dst;
    std::memcpy(&dst, &src, sizeof(To));
    return dst;
}

```

### Notes

reinterpret_cast (or equivalent explicit cast) between pointer or reference types shall not be used to reinterpret object representation in most cases because of the type aliasing rule.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_bit_cast` | `201806L` | (C++20) | `std::bit_cast` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <bit>
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
Â 
constexpr double f64v = 19880124.0; 
constexpr auto u64v = std::bit_cast<std::uint64_t>(f64v);
static_assert(std::bit_cast<double>(u64v) == f64v); // round-trip
Â 
constexpr std::uint64_t u64v2 = 0x3fe9000000000000ull;
constexpr auto f64v2 = std::bit_cast<double>(u64v2);
static_assert(std::bit_cast<std::uint64_t>(f64v2) == u64v2); // round-trip
Â 
int main()
{
    std::cout
        << "std::bit_cast<std::uint64_t>(" << std::fixed << f64v << ") == 0x"
        << std::hex << u64v << '\n'
        << "std::bit_cast<double>(0x" << std::hex << u64v2 << ") == "
        << std::fixed << f64v2 << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
std::bit_cast<std::uint64_t>(19880124.000000) == 0x4172f58bc0000000
std::bit_cast<double>(0x3fe9000000000000) == 0.781250

```
