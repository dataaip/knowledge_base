| template< class RealType = double >  class normal_distribution; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Generates random numbers according to the Normal (or Gaussian) random number distribution. It is defined as:

:   \(\small{f(x;\mu,\sigma)}=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi} }\exp{(-\frac{1}{2}{(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})}^2)}\)f(x; μ,σ) =

    ⎞  
    ⎟  
    ⎠

Here \(\small\mu\)μ is the Mean and \(\small\sigma\)σ is the Standard deviation (**stddev**).

`std::normal_distribution` satisfies all requirements of RandomNumberDistribution.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RealType | - | The result type generated by the generator. The effect is undefined if this is not one of float, double, or long double. |

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member type | Definition |
| `result_type` (C++11) | RealType |
| `param_type` (C++11) | the type of the parameter set, see RandomNumberDistribution. |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor)(C++11) | constructs new distribution   (public member function) |
| reset(C++11) | resets the internal state of the distribution   (public member function) |
| Generation | |
| operator()")(C++11) | generates the next random number in the distribution   (public member function) |
| Characteristics | |
| meanstddev(C++11) | returns the distribution parameters   (public member function) |
| param(C++11) | gets or sets the distribution parameter object   (public member function) |
| min(C++11) | returns the minimum potentially generated value   (public member function) |
| max(C++11) | returns the maximum potentially generated value   (public member function) |

### Non-member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator==operator!=(C++11)(C++11)(removed in C++20) | compares two distribution objects   (function) |
| operator<<operator>>(C++11) | performs stream input and output on pseudo-random number distribution   (function template) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <random>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::random_device rd{};
    std::mt19937 gen{rd()};
 
    // Values near the mean are the most likely. Standard deviation
    // affects the dispersion of generated values from the mean.
    std::normal_distribution d{5.0, 2.0};
 
    // Draw a sample from the normal distribution and round it to an integer.
    auto random_int = [&d, &gen]{ return std::lround(d(gen)); };
 
    std::map<long, unsigned> histogram{};
    for (auto n{10000}; n; --n)
        ++histogram[random_int()];
 
    for (const auto [k, v] : histogram)
        std::cout << std::setw(2) << k << ' ' << std::string(v / 200, '*') << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```

 1 *
 2 ***
 3 *****
 4 ********
 5 *********
 6 *********
 7 ******
 8 ***
 9 *
