Constructs the pseudo-random number engine.

1) The default constructor.

- If the default-constructed engine is of type `std::minstd_rand0`, the 10000th consecutive invocation of it produces the value 1043618065.
- If the default-constructed engine is of type `std::minstd_rand`, the 10000th consecutive invocation of it produces the value 399268537.
2) Constructs the engine with a seed value value. The engine's initial state is determined as follows:

- If c % m == 0 and value % m == 0 are both true, the state is 1.
- Otherwise, the state is value % m.
3) Constructs the engine with a seed sequence seq. Given std::size_t(std::log2(m) / 32) + 1 as k, the engine's initial state is determined as follows:

1. Creates an invented array object a of length k + 3.
2. Calls seq.generate(a + 0, a + k + 3).
3. Let S be \(\scriptsize (\sum^{k-1}_{j=0} a_{j+3} \cdot 2^{32j}) \mod m \)(∑k-1  
   j=0 aj+3·232j  
   ) mod m.
4. If both c % m == 0 and S == 0 are true, sets the engine's state to 1. Otherwise, sets the engine’s state to S.
 This overload participates in overload resolution only if `SeedSeq` meets the requirements of SeedSequence.4) The copy constructor. Upon construction, \*this == other is true.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | - | seed value to use in the initialization of the internal state |
| seq | - | seed sequence to use in the initialization of the internal state |

### Complexity

1,2) Constant.3) Same as the complexity of the `seq.generate` call.4) Constant.

### Exceptions

3) If `SeedSeq` is not std::seed_seq, throws the exceptions thrown by the `seq.generate` call.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2181 | C++11 | overload (3) would not throw even if the `seq.generate` call throws | propagates the exception |
| P0935R0 | C++11 | the default constructor was explicit | made implicit |
