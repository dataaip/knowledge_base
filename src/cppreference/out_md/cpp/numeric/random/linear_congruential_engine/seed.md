Sets the state of the random-number engine.

1) Right after the state is set, \*this == std::linear_congruential_engine(value) is true.2) Right after the state is set, \*this == std::linear_congruential_engine(seq) is true.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | - | seed value to use to set the state |
| seq | - | seed sequence to use to set the state |

### Exceptions

2) If `SeedSeq` is not std::seed_seq, throws the exceptions thrown by the `seq.generate` call.

### Complexity

1) Same as std::linear_congruential_engine(value).2) Same as std::linear_congruential_engine(seq).

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2181 | C++11 | overload (2) would not throw even if the `seq.generate` call throws | propagates the exception |
