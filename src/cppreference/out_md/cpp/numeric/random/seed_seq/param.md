std::seed_seq

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Member functions | | | | |
| seed_seq::seed_seq | | | | |
| seed_seq::generate | | | | |
| seed_seq::size | | | | |
| ****seed_seq::param**** | | | | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template< class OutputIt >  void param( OutputIt dest ) const; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Copies the stored seeds to the range beginning with dest. Equivalent to std::copy(`v` ﻿.begin(),`v` ﻿.end(), dest);.

If values of type `result_type` are not writable to dest, the program is ill-formed.

If `OutputIt` does not satisfy the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dest | - | the beginning iterator of the output range |

### Exceptions

Only throws the exceptions thrown by the operations on dest.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <random>
 
int main()
{
    std::seed_seq s1 = {-1, 0, 1};
    s1.param(std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "));
}

```

Output:

```
-1 0 1

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2180 | C++11 | `seed_seq::param` is non-throwing | it may throw exceptions |
