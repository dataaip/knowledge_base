| template< std::size_t I >  friend constexpr T& get( std::complex<T>& x ); | (1) | (since C++26) |
| template< std::size_t I >  friend constexpr const T& get( const std::complex<T>& x ); | (2) | (since C++26) |
| template< std::size_t I >  friend constexpr T&& get( std::complex<T>&& x ); | (3) | (since C++26) |
| template< std::size_t I >  friend constexpr const T&& get( const std::complex<T>&& x ); | (4) | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the reference to real or imaginary part from a `complex` when I == 0 or I == 1, respectively. It is mainly provided for structured binding support.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | - | a `complex` |

### Return value

1-4) A reference to the real or imaginary part from the stored one when I == 0 or I == 1, respectively.

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_tuple_like` | `202311L` | (C++26) | Add tuple protocol to std::complex |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <complex>
 
static_assert([z = std::complex(1.0, 2.0)]
{
#if __cpp_lib_tuple_like >= 202311L
    return std::get<0>(z) == 1.0 and std::get<1>(z) == 2.0;
#else
    return z.real() == 1.0 and z.imag() == 2.0;
#endif
}());
 
int main() {}

```
