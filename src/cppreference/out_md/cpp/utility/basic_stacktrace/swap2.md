| Defined in header `<stacktrace>` |  |  |
| template< class Allocator >  void swap( std::basic_stacktrace<Allocator>& lhs, std::basic_stacktrace<Allocator>& rhs ) noexcept(noexcept(lhs.swap(rhs))); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Specializes the std::swap algorithm for std::basic_stacktrace. Swaps the contents of lhs and rhs. Equivalent to lhs.swap(rhs);.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | stacktraces whose contents to swap |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Constant.
