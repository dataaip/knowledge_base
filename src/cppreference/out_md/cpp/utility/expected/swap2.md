| friend constexpr void swap( expected& lhs, expected& rhs ) noexcept(/\*see below\*/); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Overloads the std::swap algorithm for std::expected. Exchanges the state of lhs with that of rhs. Effectively calls lhs.swap(rhs).

This overload participates in overload resolution only if lhs.swap(rhs) is valid.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::expected<T, E> is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | `expected` objects whose states to swap |

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

noexcept specification:noexcept(noexcept(lhs.swap(rhs)))

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <expected>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
using Ex = std::expected<std::string, int>;
 
void show(const Ex& ex1, const Ex& ex2)
{
    for (int i{}; i < 2; ++i)
    {
        std::cout << (i ? "ex2" : "ex1");
        if (const Ex& ex = (i ? ex2 : ex1); ex.has_value())
            std::cout << ".has_value() = " << *ex << '\n';
        else
            std::cout << ".error() = " << ex.error() << '\n';
    }
}
 
int main()
{
    Ex ex1("\N{DOG FACE}");
    Ex ex2{"\N{BONE}"};
    show(ex1, ex2);
    swap(ex1, ex2);
    std::cout << "swap(ex1, ex2);\n";
    show(ex1, ex2);
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    ex2 = std::unexpected(13);
    show(ex1, ex2);
    swap(ex1, ex2);
    std::cout << "swap(ex1, ex2);\n";
    show(ex1, ex2);
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    ex2 = std::unexpected(19937);
    show(ex1, ex2);
    swap(ex1, ex2);
    std::cout << "swap(ex1, ex2);\n";
    show(ex1, ex2);
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
ex1.has_value() = 🐶
ex2.has_value() = 🦴
swap(ex1, ex2);
ex1.has_value() = 🦴
ex2.has_value() = 🐶
 
ex1.has_value() = 🦴
ex2.error() = 13
swap(ex1, ex2);
ex1.error() = 13
ex2.has_value() = 🦴
 
ex1.error() = 13
ex2.error() = 19937
swap(ex1, ex2);
ex1.error() = 19937
ex2.error() = 13
