### Main template destructor

Destroys the contained value:

- If `has_value()` is true, destroys the expected value.
- Otherwise, destroys the unexpected value.

This destructor is trivial if std::is_trivially_destructible_v<T> and std::is_trivially_destructible_v<E> are both true.

### void partial specialization destructor

If `has_value()` is false, destroys the unexpected value.

This destructor is trivial if std::is_trivially_destructible_v<E> is true.
