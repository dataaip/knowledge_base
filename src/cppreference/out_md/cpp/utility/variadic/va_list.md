Variadic functions

`va_list` is a complete object type (in practice, a unique built-in type or char\*) suitable for holding the information needed by the macros va_start, va_copy, va_arg, and va_end.

If a `va_list` instance is created, passed to another function, and used via va_arg in that function, then any subsequent use in the calling function should be preceded by a call to va_end.

It is legal to pass a pointer to a `va_list` object to another function and then use that object after the function returns.
