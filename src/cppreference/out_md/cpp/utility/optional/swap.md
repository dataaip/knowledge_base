| void swap( optional& other ) noexcept(/\* see below \*/); |  | (since C++17)  (constexpr since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Swaps the contents with those of other.

- If neither \*this nor other contain a value, the function has no effect.

- If only one of \*this and other contains a value (let's call this object `in` and the other `un`), the contained value of `un` is direct-initialized from std::move(\*in), followed by destruction of the contained value of `in` as if by in->T::~T(). After this call, `in` does not contain a value; `un` contains a value.

- If both \*this and other contain values, the contained values are exchanged by calling using std::swap; swap(\*\*this, \*other).

The program is ill-formed unless type `T` is Swappable and std::is_move_constructible_v<T> is true.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | the `optional` object to exchange the contents with |

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

noexcept specification:noexcept(std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T> &&  
         std::is_nothrow_swappable_v<T>)

In the case of thrown exception, the states of the contained values of \*this and other are determined by the exception safety guarantees of `swap` of type `T` or `T`'s move constructor, whichever is called. For both \*this and other, if the object contained a value, it is left containing a value, and the other way round.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_optional` | `202106L` | (C++20) (DR20) | Fully constexpr |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <optional>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::optional<std::string> opt1("First example text");
    std::optional<std::string> opt2("2nd text");
 
    enum Swap { Before, After };
    auto print_opts = &
    {
        std::cout << (e == Before ? "Before swap:\n" : "After swap:\n");
        std::cout << "opt1 contains '" << opt1.value_or("") << "'\n";
        std::cout << "opt2 contains '" << opt2.value_or("") << "'\n";
        std::cout << (e == Before ? "---SWAP---\n": "\n");
    };
 
    print_opts(Before);
    opt1.swap(opt2);
    print_opts(After);
 
    // Swap with only 1 set
    opt1 = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur tincidunt.";
    opt2.reset();
 
    print_opts(Before);
    opt1.swap(opt2);
    print_opts(After);
}

```

Output:

```
Before swap:
opt1 contains 'First example text'
opt2 contains '2nd text'
---SWAP---
After swap:
opt1 contains '2nd text'
opt2 contains 'First example text'
 
Before swap:
opt1 contains 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur tincidunt.'
opt2 contains ''
---SWAP---
After swap:
opt1 contains ''
opt2 contains 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur tincidunt.'

```
