### Classes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in namespace `std::experimental::pmr` | |
| memory_resource | an abstract interface for classes that encapsulate memory resources   (class) |
| synchronized_pool_resource | a thread-safe memory_resource for managing allocations in pools of different block sizes   (class) |
| unsynchronized_pool_resource | a thread-unsafe memory_resource for managing allocations in pools of different block sizes   (class) |
| monotonic_buffer_resource | a special-purpose memory_resource that releases the allocated memory only when the resource is destroyed   (class) |
| polymorphic_allocator | an allocator that supports run-time polymorphism based on the memory_resource it is constructed with   (class template) |
| resource_adaptor | adapts an allocator into a memory_resource (alias template) |

### Functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in namespace `std::experimental::pmr` | |
| Comparison | |
| operator==operator!= | compare two `memory_resource`s   (function) |
| operator==operator!=") | compares two allocators   (function template) |
| Global memory resources | |
| new_delete_resource | returns a static program-wide `memory_resource` that uses the global operator new and operator delete to allocate and deallocate memory   (function) |
| null_memory_resource | returns a static `memory_resource` that performs no allocation   (function) |
| Default memory resource | |
| get_default_resource | gets the default `memory_resource`   (function) |
| set_default_resource | sets the default `memory_resource`   (function) |
