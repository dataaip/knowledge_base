This header is part of the ranges library.

### Range concepts

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in namespace `std::experimental::ranges` | |
| Range | specifies that a type is a range, that is, it provides a `begin` iterator and an `end` sentinel   (concept) |
| SizedRange | specifies that a range knows its size in constant time   (concept) |
| View | specifies that a range is a view, that is, it has constant time copy/move/assignment   (concept) |
| BoundedRange | specifies that a range has identical iterator and sentinel types   (concept) |
| InputRange | specifies a range whose iterator type satisfies `InputIterator`   (concept) |
| OutputRange | specifies a range whose iterator type satisfies `OutputIterator`   (concept) |
| ForwardRange | specifies a range whose iterator type satisfies `ForwardIterator`   (concept) |
| BidirectionalRange | specifies a range whose iterator type satisfies `BidirectionalIterator`   (concept) |
| RandomAccessRange | specifies a range whose iterator type satisfies `RandomAccessIterator`   (concept) |

### Range access

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in namespace `std::experimental::ranges` | |
| begincbegin") | returns an iterator to the beginning of a range (customization point object) |
| endcend") | returns an iterator to the end of a range (customization point object) |
| rbegincrbegin") | returns a reverse iterator to a range (customization point object) |
| rendcrend") | returns a reverse end iterator to a range (customization point object) |

### Range primitives

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in namespace `std::experimental::ranges` | |
| size") | obtains the size of a range whose size can be calculated in constant time (customization point object) |
| empty") | checks whether a range is empty (customization point object) |
| datacdata") | obtains a pointer to the beginning of a contiguous range (customization point object) |
| iterator_tsentinel_t | obtains the iterator and sentinel types of a range (alias template) |
