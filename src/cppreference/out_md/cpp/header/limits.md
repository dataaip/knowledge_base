### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 184 | C++98 | the definition of the specialization std::numeric_limits<bool> was not provided | provided |
| LWG 559 | C++98 | the std::numeric_limits specializations of cv-qualified arithmetic types were missing in the synopsis | added |
