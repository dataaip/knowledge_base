Construct an iterator. Overloads (3,4) are called by begin() and end() of ranges::join_with_view.

| Overload | Data members | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parent_` | `outer_it_` | `inner_it_` |
| (1) | initialized with nullptr | value-initialized (only if `Base` models `forward_range`) | default-initialized |
| (2) | initialized with i.`parent_` | initialized with std::move(i.`outer_it_`  (only if `Base` models `forward_range`) |
| (3) | initialized with  std::addressof(parent) | initialized with std::move(outer) |
| (4) | N/A |

2) After initializing the data members, equivalent to 

if (i.`inner_it_` ﻿.index() == 0)  
`inner_it_` ﻿.template emplace<0>(std::get<0>(std::move(i.`inner_it_` ﻿)));  
else  
`inner_it_` ﻿.template emplace<1>(std::get<1>(std::move(i.`inner_it_` ﻿)));

.3,4) After initializing the data members, adjust the outer iterator as if the inner iterator was incremented by `operator++()`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| i | - | a mutable iterator |
| parent | - | a std::ranges::join_with_view object |
| outer | - | an iterator into the underlying range of parent |
