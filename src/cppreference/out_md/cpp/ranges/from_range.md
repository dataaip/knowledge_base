`std::from_range` is a disambiguation tag that can be passed to the constructors of the suitable containers to indicate that the contained member is range constructed.

The corresponding type `std::from_range_t` can be used in the constructor's parameter list to match the intended tag.

### Standard library

The following standard library types use `std::from_range_t` type in their constructors:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Containers library | |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `vector` from a range   (public member function of `std::vector<T,Allocator>`) |
| (constructor)(C++26) | constructs the `inplace_vector` from a range   (public member function of `std::inplace_vector<T,N>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `deque` from a range   (public member function of `std::deque<T,Allocator>`) |

| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `set` from a range   (public member function of `std::set<Key,Compare,Allocator>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `map` from a range   (public member function of `std::map<Key,T,Compare,Allocator>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `multiset` from a range   (public member function of `std::multiset<Key,Compare,Allocator>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `multimap` from a range   (public member function of `std::multimap<Key,T,Compare,Allocator>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `unordered_set` from a range   (public member function of `std::unordered_set<Key,Hash,KeyEqual,Allocator>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `unordered_map` from a range   (public member function of `std::unordered_map<Key,T,Hash,KeyEqual,Allocator>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `unordered_multiset` from a range   (public member function of `std::unordered_multiset<Key,Hash,KeyEqual,Allocator>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `unordered_multimap` from a range   (public member function of `std::unordered_multimap<Key,T,Hash,KeyEqual,Allocator>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `priority_queue` from a range   (public member function of `std::priority_queue<T,Container,Compare>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `queue` from a range   (public member function of `std::queue<T,Container>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `stack` from a range   (public member function of `std::stack<T,Container>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `flat_set` from a range   (public member function of `std::flat_set<Key,Compare,KeyContainer>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `flat_map` from a range   (public member function of `std::flat_map<Key,T,Compare,KeyContainer,MappedContainer>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `flat_multiset` from a range   (public member function of `std::flat_multiset<Key,Compare,KeyContainer>`) |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `flat_multimap` from a range   (public member function of `std::flat_multimap<Key,T,Compare,KeyContainer,MappedContainer>`) |
| Strings library | |
| (constructor)(C++23) | constructs the `basic_string` from a range   (public member function of `std::basic_string<CharT,Traits,Allocator>`) |

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_containers_ranges` | `202202L` | (C++23) | Tagged constructors to construct from container compatible range |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <string>
Â 
int main()
{
#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
    auto const range = {0x43, 43, 43};
    std::string str{std::from_range, range}; // uses tagged constructor
    assert(str == "C++");
#endif
}

```
