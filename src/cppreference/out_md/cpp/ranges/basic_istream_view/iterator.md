ranges::basic_istream_view<Val, CharT, Traits>::`iterator` is the type of the iterators returned by `begin()` of ranges::basic_istream_view<Val, CharT, Traits>.

`iterator` is an `input_iterator`, but does not satisfy LegacyInputIterator, and thus does not work with pre-C++20 algorithms.

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `iterator_concept` | std::input_iterator_tag |
| `difference_type` | std::ptrdiff_t |
| `value_type` | `Val` |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member | Definition |
| ranges::basic_istream_view<Val, CharT, Traits> `parent_` | a pointer to the parent view (exposition-only member object\*) |

### Member functions

## std::ranges::basic_istream_view::**iterator**::**iterator**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /\*iterator\*/( const /\*iterator\*/& ) = delete; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| /\*iterator\*/( /\*iterator\*/&& ) = default; | (2) | (since C++20) |
| constexpr explicit /\*iterator\*/( basic_istream_view& parent ); | (3) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

1) The copy constructor is deleted. The iterator is not copyable.2) The move constructor is defaulted.3) Initializes `parent_` with std::addressof(parent).

## std::ranges::basic_istream_view::**iterator**::operator=

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /\*iterator\*/& operator=( const /\*iterator\*/& ) = delete; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| /\*iterator\*/& operator=( /\*iterator\*/&& ) = default; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

1) The copy assignment operator is deleted. The iterator is not copyable.2) The move assignment operator is defaulted.

## std::ranges::basic_istream_view::**iterator**::operator++

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /\*iterator\*/& operator++(); | (1) | (since C++20) |
| void operator++(int); | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

1) Equivalent to \*`parent_` ﻿->`stream_`>>`parent_` ﻿->`value_`.2) Equivalent to ++\*this.

## std::ranges::basic_istream_view::**iterator**::operator\*

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Val& operator\*() const; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Returns `parent_` ﻿->`value_`.

### Non-member functions

## operator==(std::ranges::basic_istream_view::**iterator**, std::default_sentinel)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| friend bool operator==( const /\*iterator\*/& x, std::default_sentinel_t ); |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Returns !\*`parent_` ﻿->`stream_`.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when `std::ranges::basic_istream_view::iterator` is an associated class of the arguments.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P2325R3 | C++20 | default constructor was provided as C++20 iterators must be `default_initializable` | removed along with the requirement |
