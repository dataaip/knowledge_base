| Member functions | | | | |
| common_view::common_view | | | | |
| common_view::base | | | | |

| constexpr auto end() requires (!/\*simple-view\*/<V>); | (1) | (since C++20) |
| constexpr auto end() const requires ranges::range<const V>; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

1) Returns an iterator representing the end of the `common_view`, that is:

- ranges::begin(base_) + ranges::distance(base_), if both ranges::random_access_range<V> and ranges::sized_range<V> are satisfied,
- std::common_iterator<ranges::iterator_t<V>, ranges::sentinel_t<V>>(ranges::end(base_)) otherwise.

Here `base_` (the name is for exposition purposes only) is the underlying view.2) Same as (1), but `V` is const-qualified.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

An iterator representing the end of the underlying view.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr int n{4};
 
    constexpr auto v1 = std::views::iota(1)
                      | std::views::take(n)
                      | std::views::common
                      ;
    constexpr auto v2 = std::views::iota(2)
                      | std::views::take(n)
                      ;
    const int product = std::inner_product(v1.begin(), v1.end(),
                                           v2.begin(),
                                           0);
    std::cout << product << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
40

```
