| concat_view() = default; | (1) | (since C++26) |
| constexpr concat_view( Views... views ); | (2) | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

| Overload | `views_` |
| --- | --- |
| (1) | default-initialized |
| (2) | initialized with std::move(views)... |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| views | - | view objects to adapt |

### Notes

In order to call the default constructor, `Views` must be explicitly provided and all types it contains must be default-initializable.

### Example

An early preview of the example is available in Compiler Explorer.

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
    using namespace std::ranges;
 
    static constexpr concat_view<empty_view<char>> concat1{}; // overload (1)
    static_assert(equal(concat1, views::empty<char>));
 
    static constexpr auto con = {'c', 'o', 'n'};
    static constexpr char cat[]{'c', 'a', 't', '\0'};
    static constexpr auto concat2{views::concat(con, cat)};   // overload (2)
    static_assert(equal(concat2, "concat"));
}

```
