| namespace views {  inline constexpr auto values = ranges::elements<1>; } | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Takes a `view` of **tuple-like** values (e.g. std::tuple or std::pair), and produces a view with a **value-type** of the **second** element of the adapted view's value-type.

1) An alias for ranges::elements_view<R, 1>.2) RangeAdaptorObject (and also RangeAdaptorClosureObject). The expression views::values(e) is expression-equivalent to values_view<views::all_t<decltype((e))>>{e} for any suitable subexpression e.

### Notes

values_view can be useful for extracting **values** from associative containers, e.g.

```
std::map<int, std::string> map{{1, "alpha"}, {2, "beta"}};
for (auto const& value : std::views::values(map))
    std::cout << value << ' ';
// prints: alpha beta

```

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
    const auto list = {std::pair{1, 11.1}, {2, 22.2}, {3, 33.3}};
    std::cout << "pair::second values in the list: ";
    for (double value : list | std::views::values)
        std::cout << value << ' ';
 
    std::map<char, int> map{{'A', 1}, {'B', 2}, {'C', 3}, {'D', 4}, {'E', 5}};
    auto odd = [](int x) { return 0 != (x & 1); };
    std::cout << "\nodd values in the map: ";
    for (int value : map | std::views::values | std::views::filter(odd))
        std::cout << value << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
pair::second values in the list: 11.1 22.2 33.3
odd values in the map: 1 3 5

```

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3563 | C++20 | `keys_view` is unable to participate in CTAD due to its use of views::all_t | views::all_t removed |
