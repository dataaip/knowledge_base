Increments or decrements the iterator.

Let `current_`, `end_`, `stride_`, and `missing_` be the data members of the iterator.

1) Equivalent to

```
missing_ = ranges::advance(current_, stride_, end_);
return *this

```

Before the call `current_` should not be equal to `end_`.2) Equivalent to ++\*this;.3) Equivalent to auto tmp = \*this; ++\*this; return tmp;.4) Equivalent to

```
ranges::advance(current_, missing_ - stride_);
missing_ = 0;
return *this;

```

5) Equivalent to auto tmp = \*this; --\*this; return tmp;.6) Equivalent to

```
if (n > 0)
{
    ranges::advance(current_, stride_ * (n - 1));
    missing_ = ranges::advance(current_, stride_, end_);
}
else if (n < 0)
{
    ranges::advance(current_, stride_ * n + missing_);
    missing_ = 0;
}
 
return *this;

```

If n > 0, then before the call to this function the ranges::distance(current_, end_) must be greater than stride_ \* (n - 1).

Note that if n < 0, the ranges::distance(current_, end_) is always greater than (non-positive) stride_ \* (n - 1).7) Equivalent to return \*this += -n;

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | - | position relative to current location |

### Return value

1,4,6,7) \*this2) (none)3,5) a copy of \*this that was made before the change
