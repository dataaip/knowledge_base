|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<cstring>` |  |  |
| const void\* memchr( const void\* ptr, int ch, std::size_t count ); |  |  |
| void\* memchr(       void\* ptr, int ch, std::size_t count ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Converts ch to unsigned char and locates the first occurrence of that value in the initial count bytes (each interpreted as unsigned char) of the object pointed to by ptr.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| This function behaves as if it reads the bytes sequentially and stops as soon as a matching bytes is found: if the array pointed to by ptr is smaller than count, but the match is found within the array, the behavior is well-defined. | (since C++17) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ptr | - | pointer to the object to be examined |
| ch | - | byte to search for |
| count | - | max number of bytes to examine |

### Return value

Pointer to the location of the byte, or a null pointer if no such byte is found.

### Example

Search an array of characters.

Run this code

```
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    char arr[] = {'a', '\0', 'a', 'A', 'a', 'a', 'A', 'a'};
    char *pc = (char*) std::memchr(arr, 'A', sizeof arr);
    if (pc != nullptr)
        std::cout << "search character found\n";
    else
        std::cout << "search character not found\n";
}

```

Output:

```
search character found

```
