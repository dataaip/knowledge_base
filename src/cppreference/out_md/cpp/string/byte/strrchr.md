| Defined in header `<cstring>` |  |  |
| const char\* strrchr( const char\* str, int ch ); |  |  |
| char\* strrchr(       char\* str, int ch ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Finds the last occurrence of ch (after conversion to char) in the byte string pointed to by str. The terminating null character is considered to be a part of the string and can be found if searching for '\0'.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| str | - | pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be analyzed |
| ch | - | character to search for |

### Return value

Pointer to the found character in str, or null pointer if no such character is found.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    char input[] = "/home/user/hello.c";
    char* output = std::strrchr(input, '/');
    if (output)
        std::cout << output + 1 << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
hello.c

```
