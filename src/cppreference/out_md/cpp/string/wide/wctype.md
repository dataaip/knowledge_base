| Defined in header `<cwctype>` |  |  |
| std::wctype_t wctype( const char\* str ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Constructs a value of type std::wctype_t that describes a LC_CTYPE category of wide character classification. It may be one of the standard classification categories, or a locale-specific category, such as `"jkanji"`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| str | - | C string holding the name of the desired category |

The following values of str are supported in all C locales:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| value of `str` | effect |
| `"alnum"` | identifies the category used by std::iswalnum |
| `"alpha"` | identifies the category used by std::iswalpha |
| `"blank"` | identifies the category used by std::iswblank (C++11) |
| `"cntrl"` | identifies the category used by std::iswcntrl |
| `"digit"` | identifies the category used by std::iswdigit |
| `"graph"` | identifies the category used by std::iswgraph |
| `"lower"` | identifies the category used by std::iswlower |
| `"print"` | identifies the category used by std::iswprint |
| `"space"` | identifies the category used by std::iswspace |
| `"upper"` | identifies the category used by std::iswupper |
| `"xdigit"` | identifies the category used by std::iswxdigit |

### Return value

std::wctype_t object suitable for use with std::iswctype to classify wide characters according to the named category of the current C locale or zero if str does not name a category supported by the current C locale.
