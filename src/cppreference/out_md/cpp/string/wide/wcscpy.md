| Defined in header `<cwchar>` |  |  |
| wchar_t\* wcscpy( wchar_t\* dest, const wchar_t\* src ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Copies the wide string pointed to by src (including the terminating null wide character) to wide character array pointed to by dest.

If the strings overlap, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dest | - | pointer to the wide character array to copy to |
| src | - | pointer to the null-terminated wide string to copy from |

### Return value

dest

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <clocale>
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
int main()
{
    const wchar_t* src = L"犬 means dog";
//  src[0] = L'狗'; // can't modify string literal
    auto dst = std::make_unique<wchar_t[]>(std::wcslen(src) + 1); // +1 for the null
    std::wcscpy(dst.get(), src);
    dst[0] = L'狗';
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    std::wcout.imbue(std::locale(""));
    std::wcout << src << '\n' << dst.get() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
犬 means dog
狗 means dog

```
