| CharT& operator[]( size_type pos ); | (1) | (constexpr since C++20) |
| const CharT& operator[]( size_type pos ) const; | (2) | (constexpr since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Returns a reference to the character at specified location pos if pos < size(), or a reference to CharT() if pos == size(). No bounds checking is performed.

If pos > size(), the behavior is undefined.

For overload (1), if pos == size(), the behavior is undefined if the object referred by the returned reference is modified to any value other than CharT()(since C++11).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | - | position of the character to return |

### Return value

Reference to the requested element if pos < size(), or a reference to CharT() if pos == size().

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    const std::string e("Exemplar");
    for (unsigned i = e.length() - 1; i != 0; i /= 2)
        std::cout << e[i];
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    const char* c = &e[0];
    std::cout << c << '\n'; // print as a C string
 
    // Change the last character of s into a 'y'
    std::string s("Exemplar ");
    s[s.size() - 1] = 'y'; // equivalent to s.back() = 'y';
    std::cout << s << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
rmx
Exemplar
Exemplary

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 259 | C++98 | non-const overload could return const lvalue data()[pos], which was ill-formed | changed to return \*(begin() + pos) |
| LWG 2475 | C++11 | if pos == size(), the behavior of modifying the object referred by the returned reference was undefined | well-defined if modified to CharT() |
