The type mbstate_t is a trivial non-array type that can represent any of the conversion states that can occur in an implementation-defined set of supported multibyte character encoding rules. Zero-initialized value of `mbstate_t` represents the initial conversion state, although other values of `mbstate_t` may exist that also represent the initial conversion state.

Possible implementation of `mbstate_t` is a struct type holding an array representing the incomplete multibyte character, an integer counter indicating the number of bytes in the array that have been processed, and a representation of the current shift state.

The following functions should not be called from multiple threads without synchronization with the std::mbstate_t\* argument of a null pointer due to possible data races: std::mbrlen, std::mbrtowc, std::mbsrtowcs, std::mbtowc, std::wcrtomb, std::wcsrtombs, std::wctomb.
