| Defined in header `<regex>` |  |  |
| class regex_error; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Defines the type of exception object thrown to report errors in the regular expressions library.

Inheritance diagram

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a `regex_error` object   (public member function) |
| operator= | replaces the `regex_error` object   (public member function) |
| code | gets the std::regex_constants::error_type for a `regex_error`   (public member function) |

## Inherited from std::runtime_error

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (destructor)[virtual] | destroys the exception object   (virtual public member function of `std::exception`) |
| what[virtual] | returns an explanatory string   (virtual public member function of `std::exception`) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <regex>
 
int main()
{
    try
    {
        std::regex re("[a-b][a");
    }
    catch (const std::regex_error& e)
    {
        std::cout << "regex_error caught: " << e.what() << '\n';
        if (e.code() == std::regex_constants::error_brack)
            std::cout << "The code was error_brack\n";
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
regex_error caught: The expression contained mismatched [ and ].
The code was error_brack

```
