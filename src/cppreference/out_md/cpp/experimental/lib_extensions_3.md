Version 3 of the C++ Extensions for Library Fundamentals, ISO/IEC TS 19568:2024, defines the following new components for the C++ standard library, in addition to those defined in version 1 and version 2.

Components merged into C++17/20 and the following components are removed in LFTS v3:

- std::experimental::make_array,
- std::experimental::erased_type,
- std::experimental::packaged_task, and
- std::experimental::promise.

### Scope guard

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<experimental/scope>` | |
| scope_exit | wraps a function object and invokes it on exiting the scope   (class template) |
| scope_fail | wraps a function object and invokes it on exiting the scope through an exception   (class template) |
| scope_success | wraps a function object and invokes it on exiting the scope normally   (class template) |
| unique_resource | universal RAII resource handle wrapper   (class template) |

### Feature test macros

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<experimental/memory_resource>` | |
| __cpp_lib_experimental_memory_resources | a value of at least 201803 indicates that resource_adaptor is supported   (macro constant) |
| Defined in header `<experimental/functional>` | |
| __cpp_lib_experimental_function_polymorphic_allocator | a value of at least 202211 indicates that std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<> is used for std::experimental::function   (macro constant) |
| Defined in header `<experimental/scope>` | |
| __cpp_lib_experimental_scope | a value of at least 201902 indicates that the scope guards are supported   (macro constant) |

### Notes

The value of `__cpp_lib_experimental_memory_resources` has been increased in LFTS v3, because the design of resource_adaptor is rebased onto std::pmr::memory_resource.
