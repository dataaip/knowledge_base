| template< class M, class N >  constexpr std::common_type_t<M, N> lcm( M m, N n ); |  | (library fundamentals TS v2) |
|  |  |  |

Computes the least common multiple of the integers m and n.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| m, n | - | integer values |

### Return value

If either m or n is zero, returns zero. Otherwise, return the least common multiple of |m| and |n|.

### Remarks

If either `M` or `N` is not an integer type, or if either is (possibly cv-qualified) bool, the program is ill-formed.

The behavior is undefined if |m|, |n| or the least common multiple of |m| and |n| is not representable as a value of type `std::common_type_t<M, N>`.

### Exceptions

Throws no exceptions.
