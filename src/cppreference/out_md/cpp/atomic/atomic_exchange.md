| Defined in header `<atomic>` |  |  |
| template< class T >  T atomic_exchange( std::atomic<T>\* obj, typename std::atomic<T>::value_type desired ) noexcept; | (1) | (since C++11) |
| template< class T >  T atomic_exchange( volatile std::atomic<T>\* obj, typename std::atomic<T>::value_type desired ) noexcept; | (2) | (since C++11) |
| template< class T >  T atomic_exchange_explicit( std::atomic<T>\* obj,  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  typename std::atomic<T>::value_type desired, std::memory_order order ) noexcept; | (3) | (since C++11) |
| template< class T >  T atomic_exchange_explicit( volatile std::atomic<T>\* obj,  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  typename std::atomic<T>::value_type desired, std::memory_order order ) noexcept; | (4) | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

1,2) Atomically replaces the value pointed to by obj with the value of desired and returns the value obj held previously, as if by obj->exchange(desired).3,4) Atomically replaces the value pointed to by obj with the value of desired and returns the value obj held previously, as if by obj->exchange(desired, order).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| obj | - | pointer to the atomic object to modify |
| desired | - | the value to store in the atomic object |
| order | - | the memory synchronization ordering |

### Return value

The value held previously by the atomic object pointed to by obj.

### Example

A spinlock mutex can be implemented in userspace using an atomic exchange operation, similar to std::atomic_flag_test_and_set:

Run this code

```
#include <atomic>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
Â 
std::atomic<bool> lock(false); // holds true when locked
                               // holds false when unlocked
Â 
int new_line{1}; // the access is synchronized via atomic lock variable
Â 
void f(int n)
{
    for (int cnt = 0; cnt < 100; ++cnt)
    {
        while (std::atomic_exchange_explicit(&lock, true, std::memory_order_acquire))
            ; // spin until acquired
        std::cout << n << (new_line++ % 80 ? "" : "\n");
        std::atomic_store_explicit(&lock, false, std::memory_order_release);
    }
}
Â 
int main()
{
    std::vector<std::thread> v;
    for (int n = 0; n < 8; ++n)
        v.emplace_back(f, n);
    for (auto& t : v)
        t.join();
}

```

Possible output:
