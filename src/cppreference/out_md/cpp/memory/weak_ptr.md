`std::weak_ptr` is a smart pointer that holds a non-owning ("weak") reference to an object that is managed by std::shared_ptr. It must be converted to std::shared_ptr in order to access the referenced object.

`std::weak_ptr` models temporary ownership: when an object needs to be accessed only if it exists, and it may be deleted at any time by someone else, `std::weak_ptr` is used to track the object, and it is converted to std::shared_ptr to acquire temporary ownership. If the original std::shared_ptr is destroyed at this time, the object's lifetime is extended until the temporary std::shared_ptr is destroyed as well.

Another use for `std::weak_ptr` is to break reference cycles formed by objects managed by std::shared_ptr. If such cycle is orphaned (i.e., there are no outside shared pointers into the cycle), the `shared_ptr` reference counts cannot reach zero and the memory is leaked. To prevent this, one of the pointers in the cycle can be made weak.

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member type | Definition |
| `element_type` | |  |  | | --- | --- | | T | (until C++17) | | std::remove_extent_t<T> | (since C++17) | |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | creates a new `weak_ptr`   (public member function) |
| (destructor) | destroys a `weak_ptr`   (public member function) |
| operator= | assigns the `weak_ptr`   (public member function) |
| Modifiers | |
| reset | releases the ownership of the managed object   (public member function) |
| swap | swaps the managed objects   (public member function) |
| Observers | |
| use_count | returns the number of `shared_ptr` objects that manage the object   (public member function) |
| expired | checks whether the referenced object was already deleted   (public member function) |
| lock | creates a `shared_ptr` that manages the referenced object   (public member function) |
| owner_before | provides owner-based ordering of weak pointers   (public member function) |
| owner_hash(C++26) | provides owner-based hashing of weak pointers   (public member function) |
| owner_equal(C++26) | provides owner-based equal comparison of weak pointers   (public member function) |

### Non-member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::swap(std::weak_ptr)(C++11) | specializes the std::swap algorithm   (function template) |

### Helper classes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::atomic<std::weak_ptr>(C++20) | atomic weak pointer   (class template specialization) |

### Deduction guides (since C++17)

### Notes

Like std::shared_ptr, a typical implementation of `weak_ptr` stores two pointers:

- a pointer to the control block; and
- the stored pointer of the `shared_ptr` it was constructed from.

A separate stored pointer is necessary to ensure that converting a `shared_ptr` to `weak_ptr` and then back works correctly, even for aliased `shared_ptr`s. It is not possible to access the stored pointer in a `weak_ptr` without locking it into a `shared_ptr`.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_smart_ptr_owner_equality` | `202306L` | (C++26) | Enabling the use of `std::weak_ptr` as keys in unordered associative containers |

### Example

Demonstrates how lock is used to ensure validity of the pointer.

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
Â 
std::weak_ptr<int> gw;
Â 
void observe()
{
    std::cout << "gw.use_count() == " << gw.use_count() << "; ";
    // we have to make a copy of shared pointer before usage:
    if (std::shared_ptr<int> spt = gw.lock())
        std::cout << "*spt == " << *spt << '\n';
    else
        std::cout << "gw is expired\n";
}
Â 
int main()
{
    {
        auto sp = std::make_shared<int>(42);
        gw = sp;
Â 
        observe();
    }
Â 
    observe();
}

```

Output:

```
gw.use_count() == 1; *spt == 42
gw.use_count() == 0; gw is expired

```
