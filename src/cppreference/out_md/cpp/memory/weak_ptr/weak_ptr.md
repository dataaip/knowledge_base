Constructs new `weak_ptr` that potentially shares an object with r.

1) Default constructor. Constructs empty `weak_ptr`.2) Constructs new `weak_ptr` which shares an object managed by r. If r manages no object, \*this manages no object too. The templated overloads don't participate in the overload resolution unless `Y*` is implicitly convertible to `T*`, or `Y` is the type "array of `N` `U`" for some type `U` and some number `N`, and `T` is the type "array of unknown bound of (possibly cv-qualified) `U`"(since C++17).3) Move constructors. Moves a weak_ptr instance from r into \*this. After this, r is empty and r.use_count() == 0. The templated overload doesn't participate in the overload resolution unless `Y*` is implicitly convertible to `T*`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| r | - | a std::shared_ptr or std::weak_ptr that will be viewed by this std::weak_ptr |

### Notes

Because the default constructor is `constexpr`, static std::weak_ptrs are initialized as part of static non-local initialization, before any dynamic non-local initialization begins. This makes it safe to use a std::weak_ptr in a constructor of any static object.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
struct Foo {};
 
int main()
{
    std::weak_ptr<Foo> w_ptr;
 
    {
        auto ptr = std::make_shared<Foo>();
        w_ptr = ptr;
        std::cout << "w_ptr.use_count() inside scope: " << w_ptr.use_count() << '\n';
    }
 
    std::cout << "w_ptr.use_count() out of scope: " << w_ptr.use_count() << '\n';
    std::cout << "w_ptr.expired() out of scope: "
              << std::boolalpha << w_ptr.expired() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
w_ptr.use_count() inside scope: 1
w_ptr.use_count() out of scope: 0
w_ptr.expired() out of scope: true

```
