|  |  |  |

Compares two `shared_ptr<T>` objects or compares `shared_ptr<T>` with a null pointer.

Note that the comparison operators for `shared_ptr` simply compare pointer values; the actual objects pointed to are **not** compared. Having `operator<` defined for `shared_ptr` allows `shared_ptr`s to be used as keys in associative containers, like std::map and std::set.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, and `!=` operators are synthesized from operator<=> and operator== respectively. | (since C++20) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs | - | the left-hand `shared_ptr` to compare |
| rhs | - | the right-hand `shared_ptr` to compare |

### Return value

1) lhs.get() == rhs.get()2) !(lhs == rhs)3) std::less<V>()(lhs.get(), rhs.get()), where V is the composite pointer type of std::shared_ptr<T>::element_type\* and std::shared_ptr<U>::element_type\*.4) rhs < lhs5) !(rhs < lhs)6) !(lhs < rhs)7) std::compare_three_way{}(x.get(), y.get())8) !lhs9) !rhs10) (bool)lhs11) (bool)rhs12) std::less<std::shared_ptr<T>::element_type\*>()(lhs.get(), nullptr)13) std::less<std::shared_ptr<T>::element_type\*>()(nullptr, rhs.get())14) nullptr < lhs15) rhs < nullptr16) !(nullptr < lhs)17) !(rhs < nullptr)18) !(lhs < nullptr)19) !(nullptr < rhs)20) std::compare_three_way{}(x.get(), static_cast<std::shared_ptr<T>::element_type\*>(nullptr))

### Notes

In all cases, it is the stored pointer (the one returned by get()) that is compared, rather than the managed pointer (the one passed to the deleter when use_count goes to zero). The two pointers may differ in a shared_ptr created using the aliasing constructor.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
int main()
{
    std::shared_ptr<int> p1(new int(42));
    std::shared_ptr<int> p2(new int(42));
 
    std::cout << std::boolalpha
        << "(p1 == p1)       : " << (p1 == p1) << '\n'
        << "(p1 <=> p1) == 0 : " << ((p1 <=> p1) == 0) << '\n' // Since C++20
 
    // p1 and p2 point to different memory locations, so p1 != p2
        << "(p1 == p2)       : " << (p1 == p2) << '\n'
        << "(p1 < p2)        : " << (p1 < p2) << '\n'
        << "(p1 <=> p2) < 0  : " << ((p1 <=> p2) < 0) << '\n'   // Since C++20
        << "(p1 <=> p2) == 0 : " << ((p1 <=> p2) == 0) << '\n'; // Since C++20
}

```

Possible output:

```
(p1 == p1)       : true
(p1 <=> p1) == 0 : true
(p1 == p2)       : false
(p1 < p2)        : true
(p1 <=> p2) < 0  : true
(p1 <=> p2) == 0 : false

```
