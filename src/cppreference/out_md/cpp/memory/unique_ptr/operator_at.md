|  |  |  |

`operator[]` provides access to elements of an array managed by a `unique_ptr`.

The parameter i shall be less than the number of elements in the array; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

This member function is only provided for specializations for array types.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| i | - | the index of the element to be returned |

### Return value

Returns the element at index i, i.e. [`get()[i]`](get.html "cpp/memory/unique ptr/get").

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
int main() 
{
    const int size = 10; 
    std::unique_ptr<int[]> fact(new int[size]);
 
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i)
        fact[i] = (i == 0) ? 1 : i * fact[i - 1];
 
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i)
        std::cout << i << "! = " << fact[i] << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
0! = 1
1! = 1
2! = 2
3! = 6
4! = 24
5! = 120
6! = 720
7! = 5040
8! = 40320
9! = 362880

```
