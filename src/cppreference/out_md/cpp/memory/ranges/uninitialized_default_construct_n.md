| Defined in header `<memory>` |  |  |
| Call signature |  |  |
| template< no-throw-forward-iterator I >  Â  Â  requires std::default_initializable<std::iter_value_t<I>>  I uninitialized_default_construct_n( I first, std::iter_difference_t<I> count ); |  | (since C++20)  (constexpr since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

Constructs objects of type std::iter_value_t<I> in the uninitialized memory area first`+```â€‹0â€‹`,`count`)` by [default-initialization, as if by
return ranges::uninitialized_default_construct(std::counted_iterator(first, count),  
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â std::default_sentinel).base();

If an exception is thrown during the initialization, the objects already constructed are destroyed in an unspecified order.

The function-like entities described on this page are **algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first | - | the beginning of the range of elements to initialize |
| count | - | the number of elements to construct |

### Return value

As described above.

### Complexity

Linear in count.

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown on construction of the elements in the destination range.

### Notes

An implementation may skip the objects construction (without changing the observable effect) if no non-trivial default constructor is called while default-initializing a std::iter_value_t<I> object, which can be detected by std::is_trivially_default_constructible.

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_raw_memory_algorithms` | `202411L` | (C++26) | constexpr for specialized memory algorithms |

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text struct uninitialized_default_construct_n_fn {     template<no-throw-forward-iterator I>         requires std::default_initializable<std::iter_value_t<I>>     constexpr I operator()(I first, std::iter_difference_t<I> count) const     {         auto iter = std::counted_iterator(first, count);         return ranges::uninitialized_default_construct(iter, std::default_sentinel).base();     } }; Â  inline constexpr uninitialized_default_construct_n_fn uninitialized_default_construct_n{}; ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
Â 
int main()
{
    struct S { std::string m{"â–ˆâ–“â–’â–‘ â–ˆâ–“â–’â–‘ "}; };
Â 
    constexpr int n{4};
    alignas(alignof(S)) char out[n * sizeof(S)];
Â 
    try
    {
        auto first{reinterpret_cast<S*>(out)};
        auto last = std::ranges::uninitialized_default_construct_n(first, n);
Â 
        auto count{1};
        for (auto it{first}; it != last; ++it)
            std::cout << count++ << ' ' << it->m << '\n';
Â 
        std::ranges::destroy(first, last);
    }
    catch (...)
    {
        std::cout << "Exception!\n";
    }
Â 
    // For scalar types, uninitialized_default_construct_n
    // generally does not zero-fill the given uninitialized memory area.
    constexpr int sample[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
    int v[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
    std::ranges::uninitialized_default_construct_n(std::begin(v), std::size(v));
    if (std::memcmp(v, sample, sizeof(v)) == 0)
    {
        // Maybe undefined behavior, pending CWG 1997:
        // for (const int iÂ : v) { std::cout << i << ' '; }
        for (const int i : sample)
            std::cout << i << ' ';
    }
    else
        std::cout << "Unspecified!";
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
1 â–ˆâ–“â–’â–‘ â–ˆâ–“â–’â–‘
2 â–ˆâ–“â–’â–‘ â–ˆâ–“â–’â–‘
3 â–ˆâ–“â–’â–‘ â–ˆâ–“â–’â–‘
4 â–ˆâ–“â–’â–‘ â–ˆâ–“â–’â–‘
1 2 3 4 5 6

```
