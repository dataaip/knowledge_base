| Defined in header `<memory>` |  |  |
| Call signature |  |  |
| template< no-throw-forward-iterator I, no-throw-sentinel-for<I> S >  Â  Â  requires std::default_initializable<std::iter_value_t<I>> I uninitialized_value_construct( I first, S last ); | (1) | (since C++20)  (constexpr since C++26) |

|  |  |  |

1) Constructs objects of type std::iter_value_t<I> in the uninitialized memory area ``first`,`last`)` by [value-initialization, as if by

for (; first != last; ++first)  
::new (**voidify**(\*first))  
std::remove_reference_t<std::iter_reference_t<I>>();  
return first;

 If an exception is thrown during the initialization, the objects already constructed are destroyed in an unspecified order.2) Equivalent to ranges::uninitialized_value_construct(ranges::begin(r), ranges::end(r)).

The function-like entities described on this page are **algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | iterator-sentinel pair denoting the range of elements to value-initialize |
| r | - | the range of the elements to value-initialize |

### Return value

As described above.

### Complexity

Linear in the distance between first and last.

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown on construction of the elements in the destination range.

### Notes

An implementation may improve the efficiency of the `ranges::uninitialized_value_construct`, e.g. by using ranges::fill, if the value type of the range is a CopyAssignable TrivialType.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Possible implementation

| ```text struct uninitialized_value_construct_fn {     template<no-throw-forward-iterator I, no-throw-sentinel-for<I> S>         requires std::value_initializable<std::iter_value_t<I>>     constexpr I operator()(I first, S last) const     {         using ValueType = std::remove_reference_t<std::iter_reference_t<I>>;         if constexpr (std::is_trivially_default_constructible_v<ValueType>)             return ranges::fill(first, last, ValueType());         I rollback{first};         try         {             for (; !(first == last); ++first)                 ::new (static_cast<void*>(std::addressof(*first))) ValueType();             return first;         }         catch (...) // rollback: destroy constructed elements         {             for (; rollback != first; ++rollback)                 ranges::destroy_at(std::addressof(*rollback));             throw;         }     } Â      template<no-throw-forward-range R>         requires std::default_initializable<ranges::range_value_t<R>>     constexpr ranges::borrowed_iterator_t<R> operator()(R&& r) const     {         return (*this)(ranges::begin(r), ranges::end(r));     } }; Â  inline constexpr uninitialized_value_construct_fn uninitialized_value_construct{}; ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
Â 
int main()
{
    struct S { std::string m{"â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€"}; };
Â 
    constexpr int n{4};
    alignas(alignof(S)) char out[n * sizeof(S)];
Â 
    try
    {
        auto first{reinterpret_cast<S*>(out)};
        auto last{first + n};
Â 
        std::ranges::uninitialized_value_construct(first, last);
Â 
        auto count{1};
        for (auto it{first}; it != last; ++it)
            std::cout << count++ << ' ' << it->m << '\n';
Â 
        std::ranges::destroy(first, last);
    }
    catch (...)
    {
        std::cout << "Exception!\n";
    }
Â 
    // For scalar types, uninitialized_value_construct
    // zero-fills the given uninitialized memory area.
    int v[]{0, 1, 2, 3};
    std::cout << ' ';
    for (const int i : v)
        std::cout << ' ' << static_cast<char>(i + 'A');
    std::cout << "\n ";
    std::ranges::uninitialized_value_construct(std::begin(v), std::end(v));
    for (const int i : v)
        std::cout << ' ' << static_cast<char>(i + 'A');
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
1 â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€
2 â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€
3 â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€
4 â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€â–„â–€
  A B C D
  A A A A

```
