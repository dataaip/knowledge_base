| Defined in header `<memory>` |  |  |
| template< class Pointer, class SizeType = std::size_t >  struct allocation_result; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

`allocation_result` specializations are returned from the `allocate_at_least` member function of appropriate Allocator types (e.g. std::allocator::allocate_at_least) and std::allocator_traits::allocate_at_least.

Every specialization of `allocation_result` has no base classes or declared members other than `ptr` and `count`, thus it is suitable for aggregate initialization and structured binding.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pointer | - | typically std::allocator_traits<Alloc>::pointer, where `Alloc` is an Allocator type |
| SizeType | - | typically std::allocator_traits<Alloc>::size_type, where `Alloc` is an Allocator type |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member name | Definition |
| ptr | a pointer of type `Pointer` which is typically used for the address of the first element in the storage allocated by `allocate_at_least`   (public member object) |
| count | a value of type `SizeType` which is typically used for the actual number of elements in the storage allocated by `allocate_at_least`   (public member object) |

### Notes

`Pointer` and `SizeType` are a pointer to an object type and std::make_unsigned_t<std::ptrdiff_t> (which is almost always same as std::size_t) by default.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_allocate_at_least` | `202302L` | (C++23) | Size-feedback in the Allocator interface |
