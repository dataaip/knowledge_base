| Defined in header `<exception>` |  |  |
| [[noreturn]] void rethrow_exception( std::exception_ptr p ); |  | (since C++11)  (constexpr since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

Throws the previously captured exception object referred-to by the exception pointer p, or a copy of that object.

It is unspecified whether a copy is made. If a copy is made, the storage for it is allocated in an unspecified way.

The behavior is undefined if p is null.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p | - | non-null std::exception_ptr |

### Exceptions

The exception object referred-to by p if no copy is made.

Otherwise, a copy of such exception object if the implementation successfully copied the exception object.

Otherwise, std::bad_alloc or the exception thrown when copying the exception object, if allocation or copying fails, respectively.

### Notes

Before P1675R2, `rethrow_exception` was not allowed to copy the exception object, which is unimplementable on some platforms where exception objects are allocated on the stack.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_constexpr_exceptions` | `202411L` | (C++26) | constexpr for exception types |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <exception>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>
 
void handle_eptr(std::exception_ptr eptr) // passing by value is OK
{
    try
    {
        if (eptr)
            std::rethrow_exception(eptr);
    }
    catch(const std::exception& e)
    {
        std::cout << "Caught exception: '" << e.what() << "'\n";
    }
}
 
int main()
{
    std::exception_ptr eptr;
 
    try
    {
        [[maybe_unused]]
        char ch = std::string().at(1); // this generates a std::out_of_range
    }
    catch(...)
    {
        eptr = std::current_exception(); // capture
    }
 
    handle_eptr(eptr);
 
} // destructor for std::out_of_range called here, when the eptr is destructed

```

Possible output:

```
Caught exception: 'basic_string::at: __n (which is 1) >= this->size() (which is 0)'

```
