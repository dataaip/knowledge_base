| const std::error_category& generic_category() noexcept; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Obtains a reference to the static error category object for generic errors. The object is required to override the virtual function error_category::name() to return a pointer to the string "generic". It is used to identify error conditions that correspond to the POSIX errno codes.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A reference to the static object of unspecified runtime type, derived from std::error_category.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cerrno>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <system_error>
 
int main()
{
    std::error_condition econd = std::generic_category().default_error_condition(EDOM);
    std::cout << "Category: " << econd.category().name() << '\n'
              << "Value: " << econd.value() << '\n'
              << "Message: " << econd.message() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Category: generic
Value: 33
Message: Numerical argument out of domain

```
