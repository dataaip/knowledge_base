| Defined in header `<stdexcept>` |  |  |
| template< class T >  class tx_exception : public std::runtime_error; |  | (TM TS) |
|  |  |  |

Defines an exception type that can be used to cancel and roll back an atomic transaction initiated by the keyword atomic_cancel.

If `T` is not TriviallyCopyable, the program that specializes `std::tx_exception<T>` is ill-formed.

### Member functions

## std::tx_exception::tx_exception

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| explicit tx_exception( T value ) transaction_safe; | (1) | (TM TS) |
| tx_exception( T value, const std::string& what_arg ) transaction_safe; | (2) | (TM TS) |
| tx_exception( T value, const char\* what_arg ) transaction_safe; | (3) | (TM TS) |
| tx_exception( const tx_exception& other ) transaction_safe noexcept; | (4) | (TM TS) |
|  |  |  |

1-3) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string that can be accessed through what() and value as the object that can be accessed through get().4) Copy constructor. If \*this and other both have dynamic type `std::tx_exception<T>` then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | - | payload object |
| what_arg | - | explanatory string |
| other | - | another exception object to copy |

### Exceptions

1-3) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

## std::tx_exception::operator=

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tx_exception& operator=( const tx_exception& other ) transaction_safe noexcept; |  | (TM TS) |
|  |  |  |

Assigns the contents with those of other. If \*this and other both have dynamic type `std::tx_exception<T>` then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | another exception object to assign with |

### Return value

\*this

## std::tx_exception::get

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T get() const transaction_safe; |  | (TM TS) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the payload object held by the exception object.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

## std::tx_exception::what

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| virtual const char\* what() const transaction_safe_dynamic noexcept; |  | (TM TS) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the explanatory string.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Pointer to a null-terminated string with explanatory information.

## Inherited from std::runtime_error

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (destructor)[virtual] | destroys the exception object   (virtual public member function of `std::exception`) |
| what[virtual] | returns an explanatory string   (virtual public member function of `std::exception`) |
