### Syntax

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| `nullptr` |  |  |
|  | | | | | | | | | |

### Explanation

The keyword `nullptr` denotes the pointer literal. It is a prvalue of type std::nullptr_t. There exist implicit conversions from `nullptr` to null pointer value of any pointer type and any pointer to member type. Similar conversions exist for any null pointer constant, which includes values of type std::nullptr_t as well as the macro NULL.

### Keywords

nullptr

### Example

Demonstrates that `nullptr` retains the meaning of null pointer constant even if it is no longer a literal.

Run this code

```
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
 
template<class T>
constexpr T clone(const T& t)
{
    return t;
}
 
void g(int*)
{
    std::cout << "Function g called\n";
}
 
int main()
{
    g(nullptr);        // Fine
    g(NULL);           // Fine
    g(0);              // Fine
 
    g(clone(nullptr)); // Fine
//  g(clone(NULL));    // ERROR: non-literal zero cannot be a null pointer constant
//  g(clone(0));       // ERROR: non-literal zero cannot be a null pointer constant
}

```

Output:

```
Function g called
Function g called
Function g called
Function g called

```
