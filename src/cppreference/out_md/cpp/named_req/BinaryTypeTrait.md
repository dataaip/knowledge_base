A ****BinaryTypeTrait**** is a class template that describes a relationship between its two template type parameters with a std::integral_constant (typically std::bool_constant) specialization.

### Requirements

- DefaultConstructible and CopyConstructible.
- Takes two template type parameters (additional template parameters are optional and allowed).
- Publicly and unambiguously derived from a specialization of std::integral_constant, known as its **base characteristic**.
- The member names of the **base characteristic** are not hidden and are unambiguously available.

### Standard library

The following standard library class templates satisfy ****BinaryTypeTrait****:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| is_same(C++11) | checks if two types are the same   (class template) |
| is_base_of(C++11) | checks if a type is a base of the other type   (class template) |
| is_virtual_base_of(C++26) | checks if a type is a virtual base of the other type   (class template) |
| is_convertibleis_nothrow_convertible(C++11)(C++20) | checks if a type can be converted to the other type   (class template) |
| is_layout_compatible(C++20) | checks if two types are **layout-compatible**   (class template) |
| is_pointer_interconvertible_base_of(C++20) | checks if a type is a **pointer-interconvertible** (initial) base of another type   (class template) |
| is_invocableis_invocable_ris_nothrow_invocableis_nothrow_invocable_r(C++17) | checks if a type can be invoked (as if by std::invoke) with the given argument types   (class template) |
| uses_allocator(C++11) | checks if the specified type supports uses-allocator construction   (class template) |
