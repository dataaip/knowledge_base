Specifies that the type can be used as the template argument of std::valarray.

### Requirements

For a type `T` to be a NumericType, it must be a cv-unqualified object type that:

- Meets the DefaultConstructible, CopyConstructible, CopyAssignable and Destructible requirements.
- No operation on `T` may throw exceptions.
