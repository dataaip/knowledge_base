| void pop_back(); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Removes the last element of the container.

Calling `pop_back` on an empty container results in undefined behavior.

References and iterators to the erased element are invalidated.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <list>
#include <iostream>
 
namespace stq {
template<typename T>
void println(auto, const T& xz)
{
    std::cout << '[';
    bool first{true};
    for (auto const& x : xz)
        std::cout << (first ? first = false, "" : ", ") << x;
    std::cout << "]\n";
}
}
 
int main()
{
    std::list<int> numbers{1, 2, 3};
    stq::println("{}", numbers);
    while (not numbers.empty())
    {
        numbers.pop_back();
        stq::println("{}", numbers);
    }
}

```

Output:

```
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 2]
[1]
[]

```
