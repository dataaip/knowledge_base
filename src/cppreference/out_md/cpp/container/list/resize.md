| void resize( size_type count ); | (1) |  |
| void resize( size_type count, const value_type& value ); | (2) |  |
|  |  |  |

Resizes the container to contain count elements, does nothing if count == size().

If the current size is greater than count, the container is reduced to its first count elements.

If the current size is less than count, then:

1) Additional default-inserted elements are appended.2) Additional copies of value are appended.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| count | - | new size of the container |
| value | - | the value to initialize the new elements with |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`T` must meet the requirements of DefaultInsertable in order to use overload (1). | | |
| -`T` must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload (2). | | |

### Complexity

Linear in the difference between the current size and count.

### Notes

If value-initialization in overload (1) is undesirable, for example, if the elements are of non-class type and zeroing out is not needed, it can be avoided by providing a custom `Allocator::construct`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <list>
#include <iostream>
 
void print(auto rem, const std::list<int>& c)
{
    for (std::cout << rem; const int el : c)
        std::cout << el << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    std::list<int> c = {1, 2, 3};
    print("The list holds: ", c);
 
    c.resize(5);
    print("After resize up to 5: ", c);
 
    c.resize(2);
    print("After resize down to 2: ", c);
 
    c.resize(6, 4);
    print("After resize up to 6 (initializer = 4): ", c);
}

```

Output:

```
The list holds: 1 2 3
After resize up to 5: 1 2 3 0 0
After resize down to 2: 1 2
After resize up to 6 (initializer = 4): 1 2 4 4 4 4

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 132 | C++98 | random-access iterators were used to determine the erase range | use bidirectional iterators |
| LWG 679 | C++98 | `resize()` passed value by value | passes by const reference |
| LWG 1420 | C++98 | the behavior of resize(size()) was not specified | specified |
