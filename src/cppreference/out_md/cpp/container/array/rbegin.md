Returns a reverse iterator to the first element of the reversed `array`. It corresponds to the last element of the non-reversed `array`. If the `array` is empty, the returned iterator is equal to rend().

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Reverse iterator to the first element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

The underlying iterator of the returned reverse iterator is the end iterator. Hence the returned iterator is invalidated if and when the end iterator is invalidated.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
 
void print(const std::string_view s) { std::cout << s << ' '; }
 
int main()
{
    const std::array<std::string_view, 8> data
    {
        "▁", "▂", "▃", "▄", "▅", "▆", "▇", "█"
    };
    std::array<std::string, 8> arr;
 
    std::copy(data.cbegin(), data.cend(), arr.begin());
 
    print("Print 'arr' in direct order using cbegin, cend):\t");
    std::for_each(arr.cbegin(), arr.cend(), print);
 
    print("\n\nPrint 'arr' in reverse order using [crbegin, crend):\t");
    std::for_each(arr.crbegin(), arr.crend(), print);
}

```

Output:

```
Print 'arr' in direct order using [cbegin, cend):        ▁ ▂ ▃ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ █
 
Print 'arr' in reverse order using [crbegin, crend):     █ ▇ ▆ ▅ ▄ ▃ ▂ ▁

```
