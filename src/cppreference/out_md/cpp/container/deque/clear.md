| void clear(); |  | (noexcept since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Erases all elements from the container. After this call, size() returns zero.

Invalidates any references, pointers, and iterators referring to contained elements.
Any past-the-end iterators are also invalidated.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Linear in the size of the container, i.e., the number of elements.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
#include <deque>
 
void print_info(std::string_view rem, const std::deque<int>& v)
{
    std::cout << rem << "{ ";
    for (const auto& value : v)
        std::cout << value << ' ';
    std::cout << "}\n";
    std::cout << "Size=" << v.size() << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    std::deque<int> container{1, 2, 3};
    print_info("Before clear: ", container);
    container.clear();
    print_info("After clear: ", container);
}

```

Output:

```
Before clear: { 1 2 3 }
Size=3
After clear: { }
Size=0

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2231 | C++11 | complexity guarantee was mistakenly omitted in C++11 | complexity reaffirmed as linear |
