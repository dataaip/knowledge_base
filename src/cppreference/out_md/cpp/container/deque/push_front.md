| void push_front( const T& value ); | (1) |  |
| void push_front( T&& value ); | (2) | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Prepends the given element value to the beginning of the container.

All iterators (including the `end()` iterator) are invalidated. No references are invalidated.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | - | the value of the element to prepend |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown for any reason, these functions have no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <deque>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::deque<std::string> letters;
 
    letters.push_front("abc");
    std::string s{"def"};
    letters.push_front(std::move(s));
 
    std::cout << "std::deque letters holds: ";
    for (auto&& e : letters)
        std::cout << std::quoted(e) << ' ';
 
    std::cout << "\nMoved-from string s holds: " << std::quoted(s) << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
std::deque letters holds: "def" "abc"
Moved-from string s holds: ""

```
