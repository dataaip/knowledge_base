|  |  |  |

Attempts to extract ("splice") each element in source and insert it into \*this using the comparison object of \*this.

No elements are copied or moved, only the internal pointers of the container nodes are repointed. All pointers and references to the transferred elements remain valid, but now refer into \*this, not into source.

The behavior is undefined if get_allocator() != source.get_allocator().

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| source | - | compatible container to transfer the nodes from |

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

Does not throw unless comparison throws.

### Complexity

N \* log(size() + N)), where N is source.size().

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::multimap<int, std::string> ma{{1, "apple"}, {5, "pear"}, {10, "banana"}};
    std::multimap<int, std::string> mb{{2, "zorro"}, {4, "batman"}, {5, "X"}, {8, "alpaca"}};
    std::multimap<int, std::string> u;
    u.merge(ma);
    std::cout << "ma.size(): " << ma.size() << '\n';
    u.merge(mb);
    std::cout << "mb.size(): " << mb.size() << '\n';
 
    for (auto const& kv : u)
        std::cout << kv.first << ", " << kv.second << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
ma.size(): 0
mb.size(): 0
1, apple
2, zorro
4, batman
5, pear
5, X
8, alpaca
10, banana

```
