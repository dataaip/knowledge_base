Removes specified elements from the container. The order of the remaining equivalent elements is preserved.

1,2) Removes the element at pos.3) Removes the elements in the range ``first`,`last`)`, which must be a valid range in \*this.4) Removes all elements with the key equivalent to key.5) Removes all elements with key that compares **equivalent** to the value x. This overload participates in overload resolution only if the qualified-id Compare::is_transparent is valid and denotes a type, and neither `iterator` nor `const_iterator` is implicitly convertible from `K`. It allows calling this function without constructing an instance of `Key`.

References and iterators to the erased elements are invalidated. Other references and iterators are not affected.

The iterator pos must be valid and dereferenceable. Thus the [end() iterator (which is valid, but is not dereferenceable) cannot be used as a value for pos.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | - | iterator to the element to remove |
| first, last | - | range of elements to remove |
| key | - | key value of the elements to remove |
| x | - | a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key denoting the elements to remove |

### Return value

1-3) Iterator following the last removed element.4) Number of elements removed.5) Number of elements removed.

### Exceptions

1-3) Throws nothing.4,5) Any exceptions thrown by the `Compare` object.

### Complexity

Given an instance c of `multimap`:

1,2) Amortized constant3) log(c.size()) + std::distance(first, last)4) log(c.size()) + c.count(key)5) log(c.size()) + c.count(x)

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_associative_heterogeneous_erasure` | `202110L` | (C++23) | Heterogeneous erasure in associative containers and unordered associative containers; overload (5) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <map>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::multimap<int, std::string> c =
    {
        {1, "one"}, {2, "two"}, {3, "three"},
        {4, "four"}, {5, "five"}, {6, "six"}
    };
 
    // erase all odd numbers from c
    for (auto it = c.begin(); it != c.end();)
    {
        if (it->first % 2 != 0)
            it = c.erase(it);
        else
            ++it;
    }
 
    for (auto& p : c)
        std::cout << p.second << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
two four six

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 130 | C++98 | the return type of overloads (1) and (3) was void (it is not consistent with the `erase()` requirement on sequence containers) | corrected to `iterator` |
| LWG 371 | C++98 | the order of equivalent elements that are not erased was not guaranteed to be preserved | required to be preserved |
| LWG 2059 | C++11 | replacing overload (1) with overload (2) introduced new ambiguity | added overload (1) back |
