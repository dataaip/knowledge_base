Compares the contents of two unordered containers.

The contents of two unordered containers lhs and rhs are equal if the following conditions hold:

- lhs.size() == rhs.size().
- each group of equivalent elements ``lhs_eq1`,`lhs_eq2`)` obtained from lhs.equal_range(lhs_eq1) has a corresponding group of equivalent elements in the other container `[`rhs_eq1`,`rhs_eq2`)` obtained from rhs.equal_range(rhs_eq1), that has the following properties:

:   - [std::distance(lhs_eq1, lhs_eq2) == std::distance(rhs_eq1, rhs_eq2).
    - std::is_permutation(lhs_eq1, lhs_eq2, rhs_eq1) == true.

The behavior is undefined if `Key` is not EqualityComparable.

The behavior is also undefined if `hash_function()` and `key_eq()` do(until C++20)`key_eq()` does(since C++20) not have the same behavior on lhs and rhs or if operator== for `Key` is not a refinement of the partition into equivalent-key groups introduced by `key_eq()` (that is, if two elements that compare equal using operator== fall into different partitions).

| --- | --- |
| The `!=` operator is synthesized from `operator==`. | (since C++20) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | unordered containers to compare |

### Return value

1) true if the contents of the containers are equal, false otherwise.2) true if the contents of the containers are not equal, false otherwise.

### Complexity

Proportional to **N** calls to operator== on `value_type`, calls to the predicate returned by `key_eq`, and calls to the hasher returned by `hash_function`, in the average case, proportional to **N2** in the worst case where **N** is the size of the container.
