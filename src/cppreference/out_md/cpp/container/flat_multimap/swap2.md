| Defined in header `<flat_map>` |  |  |
| friend void swap( std::flat_multimap& lhs, std::flat_multimap& rhs ) noexcept; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Specializes the std::swap algorithm for std::flat_multimap. Swaps the contents of lhs and rhs. Calls lhs.swap(rhs).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | containers whose contents to swap |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Same as swapping the underlying containers.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <flat_map>
 
int main()
{
    std::flat_multimap<int, char> alice{{1, 'a'}, {2, 'b'}, {3, 'c'}};
    std::flat_multimap<int, char> bob{{7, 'Z'}, {8, 'Y'}, {9, 'X'}, {10, 'W'}};
 
    auto print = [](std::pair<const int, char>& n)
    {
        std::cout << ' ' << n.first << ':' << n.second;
    };
 
    // Print state before swap
    std::cout << "Alice:";
    std::for_each(alice.begin(), alice.end(), print);
    std::cout << "\nBobby:";
    std::for_each(bob.begin(), bob.end(), print);
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    std::cout << "-- SWAP\n";
    std::swap(alice, bob);
 
    // Print state after swap
    std::cout << "Alice:";
    std::for_each(alice.begin(), alice.end(), print);
    std::cout << "\nBobby:";
    std::for_each(bob.begin(), bob.end(), print);
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Alice: 1:a 2:b 3:c
Bobby: 7:Z 8:Y 9:X 10:W
-- SWAP
Alice: 7:Z 8:Y 9:X 10:W
Bobby: 1:a 2:b 3:c

```
