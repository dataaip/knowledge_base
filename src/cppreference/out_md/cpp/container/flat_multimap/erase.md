Removes specified elements from the container. The order of the remaining equivalent elements is preserved.

1,2) Removes the element at pos.3) Removes the elements in the range ``first`,`last`)`, which must be a valid range in \*this.4) Removes all elements with the key equivalent to key.5) Removes all elements with key that compares **equivalent** to the value x. This overload participates in overload resolution only if the qualified-id Compare::is_transparent is valid and denotes a type, and neither `iterator` nor `const_iterator` is implicitly convertible from `K`. It allows calling this function without constructing an instance of `Key`.

|  | Information on iterator invalidation is copied from [here |

The iterator pos must be valid and dereferenceable. Thus the end() iterator (which is valid, but is not dereferenceable) cannot be used as a value for pos.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | - | iterator to the element to remove |
| first, last | - | range of elements to remove |
| key | - | key value of the elements to remove |
| x | - | a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key denoting the elements to remove |

### Return value

1-3) Iterator following the last removed element.4) Number of elements removed.5) Number of elements removed.

### Exceptions

1-3) Throws nothing.4,5) Any exceptions thrown by the `Compare` object.

### Complexity

Depends on underlying containers. Typically linear.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <flat_map>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::flat_multimap<int, std::string> c =
    {
        {1, "one"}, {2, "two"}, {3, "three"},
        {4, "four"}, {5, "five"}, {6, "six"}
    };
 
    // erase all odd numbers from c
    for (auto it = c.begin(); it != c.end();)
    {
        if (it->first % 2 != 0)
            it = c.erase(it);
        else
            ++it;
    }
 
    for (auto& p : c)
        std::cout << p.second << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
two four six

```
