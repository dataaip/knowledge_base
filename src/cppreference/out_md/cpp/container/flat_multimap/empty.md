Checks if the underlying containers have no elements. Equivalent to: return begin() == end();.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the underlying containers are empty, false otherwise.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

The following code uses `empty` to check if a std::flat_multimap<int, int> contains any elements:

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <flat_map>
#include <utility>
 
int main()
{
    std::flat_multimap<int,int> numbers;
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << "Initially, numbers.empty(): " << numbers.empty() << '\n';
 
    numbers.emplace(42, 13);
    numbers.insert(std::make_pair(13317, 123));
    std::cout << "After adding elements, numbers.empty(): " << numbers.empty() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Initially, numbers.empty(): true
After adding elements, numbers.empty(): false

```
