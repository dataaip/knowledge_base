| Defined in header `<flat_set>` |  |  |
| template< class Key, class Compare, class KeyContainer,  class Pred >  std::flat_set<Key, Compare, KeyContainer>::size_type      erase_if( std::flat_set<Key, Compare, KeyContainer>& c,               Pred pred ); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Erases all elements that satisfy the predicate pred from c.

The predicate pred is satisfied if the expression bool(pred(std::as_const(e))) is true, where `e` is some element in c.

`Key` must be MoveAssignable. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c | - | container adaptor from which to erase |
| pred | - | predicate that returns true if the element should be erased |

### Return value

The number of erased elements.

### Complexity

Exactly c.size() applications of the predicate pred.

### Exceptions

If `erase_if` throws, c remains in valid but unspecified (maybe empty) state.

### Notes

The algorithm is **stable**, that is, the order of elements that are not deleted remains unchanged.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <flat_set>
 
void println(auto rem, auto const& container)
{
    std::cout << rem << '{';
    for (char sep[]{0, ' ', 0}; const auto& item : container)
        std::cout << sep << item, *sep = ',';
    std::cout << "}\n";
}
 
int main()
{
    std::flat_set data{3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 2, 1, 0};
    println("Original:\n", data);
 
    auto divisible_by_3 = [](auto const& x) { return (x % 3) == 0; };
 
    const auto count = std::erase_if(data, divisible_by_3);
 
    println("Erase all items divisible by 3:\n", data);
    std::cout << count << " items erased.\n";
}

```

Output:

```
Original:
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Erase all items divisible by 3:
{1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
3 items erased.

```
