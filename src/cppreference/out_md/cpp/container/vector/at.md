| reference at( size_type pos ); | (1) | (constexpr since C++20) |
| const_reference at( size_type pos ) const; | (2) | (constexpr since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Returns a reference to the element at specified location pos, with bounds checking.

If pos is not within the range of the container, an exception of type std::out_of_range is thrown.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | - | position of the element to return |

### Return value

Reference to the requested element

### Exceptions

std::out_of_range if pos >= size().

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stdexcept>
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> data{1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6};
 
    // Set element 1
    data.at(1) = 88;
 
    // Read element 2
    std::cout << "Element at index 2 has value " << data.at(2) << '\n';
 
    std::cout << "data size = " << data.size() << '\n';
 
    try
    {
        // Try to set an element at random position >= size()
        auto moon_phase = []
        {
            return std::chrono::system_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count() % 8;
        };
        data.at(data.size() + moon_phase()) = 13;
    }
    catch(const std::out_of_range& ex)
    {
        std::cout << ex.what() << '\n';
    }
 
    // Print final values
    std::cout << "data:";
    for (int elem : data)
        std::cout << ' ' << elem;
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
Element at index 2 has value 4
data size = 6
vector::_M_range_check: __n (which is 8) >= this->size() (which is 6)
data: 1 88 4 5 5 6

```
