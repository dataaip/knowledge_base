| Defined in header `<flat_set>` |  |  |
| template< class Key, class Compare, class KeyContainer, class Allocator >  struct uses_allocator<std::flat_multiset<Key, Compare, KeyContainer>, Allocator> : std::bool_constant<std::uses_allocator_v<KeyContainer, Allocator>> {}; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Provides a transparent specialization of the std::uses_allocator type trait for std::flat_multiset: the container adaptor uses allocator if and only if the underlying container does.

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| value[static] | true   (public static member constant) |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator bool | converts the object to bool, returns value   (public member function) |
| operator()(C++14) | returns value   (public member function) |

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `value_type` | bool |
| `type` | std::integral_constant<bool, value> |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <memory>
#include <flat_set>
 
static_assert(
    std::uses_allocator<std::flat_multiset<int>, void>::value == false &&
    std::uses_allocator<std::flat_multiset<int>, std::allocator<int>>::value == true
);
 
int main() {}

```
