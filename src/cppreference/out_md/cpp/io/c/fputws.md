| Defined in header `<cwchar>` |  |  |
| int fputws( const wchar_t\* str, std::FILE\* stream ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Writes every wide character from the null-terminated wide string `str` to the output stream `stream`, as if by repeatedly executing std::fputwc.

The terminating null wide character from `str` is not written.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| str | - | null-terminated wide string to be written |
| stream | - | output stream |

### Return value

On success, returns a non-negative value

On failure, returns EOF and sets the **error** indicator (see std::ferror) on `stream`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <clocale>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cwchar>
 
int main()
{
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    int rc = std::fputws(L"御休みなさい", stdout);
 
    if (rc == EOF)
        std::perror("fputws()"); // POSIX requires that errno is set
}

```

Possible output:

```
御休みなさい

```
