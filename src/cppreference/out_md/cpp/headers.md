### C compatibility headers

For some of the C standard library headers of the form `xxx.h`, the C++ standard library both includes an identically-named header and another header of the form `cxxx` (all meaningful `cxxx` headers are listed above). The intended use of headers of form `xxx.h` is for interoperability only. It is possible that C++ source files need to include one of these headers in order to be valid ISO C. Source files that are not intended to also be valid ISO C should not use any of the C headers.

With the exception of `complex.h`, each `xxx.h` header included in the C++ standard library places in the global namespace each name that the corresponding `cxxx` header would have placed in the std namespace.

These headers are allowed to also declare the same names in the std namespace, and the corresponding `cxxx` headers are allowed to also declare the same names in the global namespace: including <cstdlib> definitely provides std::malloc and may also provide ::malloc. Including <stdlib.h> definitely provides ::malloc and may also provide std::malloc. This applies even to functions and function overloads that are not part of C standard library.

Notes: `xxx.h` headers are deprecated in C++98 and undeprecated in C++23. These headers are discouraged for pure C++ code, but not subject to future removal.

#### Special C compatibility headers

The header <stdatomic.h> declares names which are also provided in the C standard library, and defines the `_Atomic` macro which is a keyword in C. Unlike other `xxx.h` headers, corresponding `<cstdatomic>` is not provided.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| <stdatomic.h>(C++23) | Defines `_Atomic` and provides corresponding components in the C standard library |

#### Empty C headers

The headers <complex.h>, <ccomplex>, <tgmath.h>, and <ctgmath> do not contain any content from the C standard library and instead merely include other headers from the C++ standard library.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| <ccomplex>(C++11)(deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20) | Simply includes the header <complex> |
| <complex.h>(C++11) | Simply includes the header <complex> |
| <ctgmath>(C++11)(deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20) | Simply includes the headers <complex> and <cmath>: the overloads equivalent to the contents of the C header `tgmath.h` are already provided by those headers |
| <tgmath.h>(C++11) | Simply includes the headers <complex> and <cmath> |

#### Meaningless C headers

The headers <ciso646>, <cstdalign>, and <cstdbool> are meaningless in C++ because the macros they provide in C are language keywords in C++.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| <ciso646>(removed in C++20) | Empty header. The macros that appear in `iso646.h` in C are keywords in C++ |
| <cstdalign>(C++11)(deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20) | Defines one compatibility macro constant |
| <cstdbool>(C++11)(deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20) | Defines one compatibility macro constant |
| <iso646.h> | Has no effect |
| <stdalign.h>(C++11) | Defines one compatibility macro constant |
| <stdbool.h>(C++11) | Defines one compatibility macro constant |

#### Unsupported C headers

The C headers <stdatomic.h>,(until C++23) <stdnoreturn.h>, and <threads.h> are not included in C++ and have no `cxxx` equivalents.

### Experimental libraries

C++ TR's/TS's also define several collections of headers.
