| Defined in header `<concepts>` |  |  |
| template< class T, class U >  concept same_as = /\* see below \*/; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The concept `same_as<T, U>` is satisfied if and only if `T` and `U` denote the same type.

std::same_as<T, U> subsumes std::same_as<U, T> and vice versa.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text namespace detail {     template< class T, class U >     concept SameHelper = std::is_same_v<T, U>; }   template< class T, class U > concept same_as = detail::SameHelper<T, U> && detail::SameHelper<U, T>; ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <concepts>
#include <iostream>
 
template<typename T, typename ... U>
concept IsAnyOf = (std::same_as<T, U> || ...);
 
template<typename T>
concept IsPrintable = std::integral<T> || std::floating_point<T> ||
    IsAnyOf<std::remove_cvref_t<std::remove_pointer_t<std::decay_t<T>>>, char, wchar_t>;
 
void println(IsPrintable auto const ... arguments)
{
    (std::wcout << ... << arguments) << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    println("Example: ", 3.14, " : ", 42, " : [", 'a', L'-', L"Z]");
}

```

Output:

```
Example: 3.14 : 42 : [a-Z]

```
