| template< class From, class To >  concept convertible_to =      std::is_convertible_v<From, To> &&      requires {          static_cast<To>(std::declval<From>()); }; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The concept convertible_to<From, To> specifies that an expression of the same type and value category as those of std::declval<From>() can be implicitly and explicitly converted to the type `To`, and the two forms of conversion produce equal results.

### Semantic requirements

convertible_to<From, To> is modeled only if, given a function `fun` of type std::add_rvalue_reference_t<From>() such that the expression fun() is equality-preserving,

- Either
  - `To` is neither an object type nor a reference-to-object type, or
  - static_cast<To>(fun()) is equal to []() -> To { return fun(); }(), and

- One of the following is true:
  - std::add_rvalue_reference_t<From> is not a reference-to-object type, or
  - std::add_rvalue_reference_t<From> is an rvalue reference to a non-const-qualified type, and the resulting state of the object referenced by fun() is valid but unspecified after either expression above; or
  - the object referred to by fun() is not modified by either expression above.

### Equality preservation

Expressions declared in requires expressions of the standard library concepts are required to be equality-preserving (except where stated otherwise).
