| Defined in header `<concepts>` |  |  |
| template< class T >  concept move_constructible = std::constructible_from<T, T> && std::convertible_to<T, T>; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The concept `move_constructible` is satisfied if `T` is a reference type, or if it is an object type where an object of that type can be constructed from an rvalue of that type in both direct- and copy-initialization contexts, with the usual semantics.

### Semantic requirements

If `T` is an object type, then `move_constructible<T>` is modeled only if given

- `rv`, an rvalue of type `T`, and
- `u2`, a distinct object of type `T` equal to `rv`,

the following are true:

- After the definition T u = rv;, `u` is equal to `u2`;
- `T(rv)` is equal to `u2`; and
- If `T` is not const-qualified, then `rv`'s resulting state (after the definition/expression is evaluated in either bullets above) is valid but unspecified; otherwise, it is unchanged.
