| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| const std::chrono::time_zone\* current_zone(); |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Convenience function for obtaining local time zone from the time zone database. Equivalent to std::chrono::get_tzdb().current_zone().

### Exceptions

std::runtime_error if this is the first reference to the time zone database and the time zone database cannot be initialized.

### Notes

A call to this function that is the first reference to the time zone database will cause it to be initialized.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
 
int main() {
    const std::chrono::zoned_time cur_time{ std::chrono::current_zone(),
                                            std::chrono::system_clock::now() };
    std::cout << cur_time << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
2021-09-13 19:46:42.249182012 MAGT

```
