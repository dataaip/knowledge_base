| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| struct sys_info; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The class `sys_info` describes time zone information associated with a time zone at a particular point in time (represented as either a std::chrono::sys_time or a std::chrono::local_time). This is a low-level data structure typically not used directly by user code.

### Member objects

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member object | Type |
| `begin`, `end` | std::chrono::sys_seconds |
| `offset` | std::chrono::seconds |
| `save` | std::chrono::minutes |
| `abbrev` | std::string |

The `begin` and `end` data members indicate the range - ``begin`,`end`)` - in which the `offset` and `abbrev` are in effect for the time zone associated with this `sys_info`.

The `offset` and `abbrev` data member indicate the UTC offset and time zone abbreviation, respectively, in effect for the associated time zone and [std::chrono::time_point. Note that time zone abbreviations are not unique.

The `save` data member, if nonzero, indicates that the time zone is on daylight saving time at the specified time point. In this case, offset - save is a suggestion of what offset this time zone might use if it were off daylight saving time. However, this information is not authoritative: the only way to ascertain the actual offset is to query the time zone with a time point that is actually off daylight savings time (i.e. returns a `sys_info` such that save == 0min).

### Nonmember functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator<<(C++20) | outputs a `sys_info` into a stream   (function template) |

### Helper classes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::formatter<std::chrono::sys_info>(C++20) | formatting support for `sys_info`   (class template specialization) |
