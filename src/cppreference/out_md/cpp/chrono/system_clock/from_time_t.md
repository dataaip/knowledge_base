| static std::chrono::system_clock::time_point from_time_t( std::time_t t ) noexcept; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Converts t to a time point type, using the coarser precision of the two types.

If `time_point` has lower precision, it is implementation defined whether the value is rounded or truncated.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| t | - | std::time_t value to convert |

### Return value

A value of type `std::chrono::system_clock::time_point` representing t.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
int main()
{
    using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
    const std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr); // usually has "1 second" precision
 
    const auto from = std::chrono::system_clock::from_time_t(t);
 
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(500ms);
 
    const auto diff = std::chrono::system_clock::now() - from;
 
    std::cout << diff << " ("
              << std::chrono::round<std::chrono::milliseconds>(diff)
              << ")\n";
}

```

Possible output:

```
987654321ns (987ms)

```
