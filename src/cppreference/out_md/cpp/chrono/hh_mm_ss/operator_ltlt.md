|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| template< class CharT, class Traits, class Duration >  std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&      operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os, const std::chrono::hh_mm_ss<Duration>& t ); |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Outputs t into the stream os.

Equivalent to return os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L%T}"), hms); where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L%T}") is "{:L%T}" if `CharT` is char, and L"{:L%T}" if `CharT` is wchar_t.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| os | - | the output stream |
| t | - | the time of day to be output |

### Return value

os
