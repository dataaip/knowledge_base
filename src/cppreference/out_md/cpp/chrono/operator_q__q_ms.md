| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| constexpr std::chrono::milliseconds      operator""ms( unsigned long long ms ); | (1) | (since C++14) |
| constexpr std::chrono::duration</\*unspecified\*/, std::milli>      operator""ms( long double ms ); | (2) | (since C++14) |
|  |  |  |

Forms a std::chrono::duration literal representing milliseconds.

1) Integer literal, returns exactly std::chrono::milliseconds(ms).2) Floating-point literal, returns a floating-point duration equivalent to std::chrono::milliseconds.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ms | - | the number of milliseconds |

### Return value

The std::chrono::duration literal.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text constexpr std::chrono::milliseconds operator""ms(unsigned long long ms) {     return std::chrono::milliseconds(ms); } constexpr std::chrono::duration<long double, std::milli> operator""ms(long double ms) {     return std::chrono::duration<long double, std::milli>(ms); } ``` |

### Notes

This operator is declared in the namespace std::literals::chrono_literals, where both literals and chrono_literals are inline namespaces. Access to this operator can be gained with:

- using namespace std::literals,
- using namespace std::chrono_literals, or
- using namespace std::literals::chrono_literals.

In addition, within the namespace std::chrono, the directive using namespace literals::chrono_literals; is provided by the standard library, so that if a programmer uses using namespace std::chrono; to gain access to the classes in the chrono library, the corresponding literal operators become visible as well.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    using namespace std::chrono_literals;
    constexpr auto d1{250ms};
    constexpr std::chrono::milliseconds d2{1s};
    std::cout << d1 << " = " << d1.count() << " milliseconds\n"
              << d2 << " = " << d2.count() << " milliseconds\n";
}

```

Output:

```
250ms = 250 milliseconds
1000ms = 1000 milliseconds

```
