### Functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<ctime>` | |
| Time manipulation | |

| time | returns the current time of the system as time since epoch   (function) |
| clock | returns raw processor clock time since the program is started   (function) |
| timespec_get(C++17) | returns the calendar time in seconds and nanoseconds based on a given time base   (function) |
| Format conversions | |
| asctime | converts a std::tm object to a textual representation   (function) |
| ctime | converts a std::time_t object to a textual representation   (function) |
| strftime | converts a std::tm object to custom textual representation   (function) |
| wcsftime | converts a std::tm object to custom wide string textual representation   (function) |
| gmtime | converts time since epoch to calendar time expressed as Universal Coordinated Time   (function) |
| localtime | converts time since epoch to calendar time expressed as local time   (function) |
| mktime | converts calendar time to time since epoch   (function) |

### Constants
