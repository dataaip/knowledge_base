| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| constexpr chrono::minutes      operator""min( unsigned long long mins ); | (1) | (since C++14) |
| constexpr chrono::duration</\*unspecified\*/, ratio<60,1>>      operator""min( long double mins ); | (2) | (since C++14) |
|  |  |  |

Forms a std::chrono::duration literal representing minutes.

1) Integer literal, returns exactly std::chrono::minutes(mins).2) Floating-point literal, returns a floating-point duration equivalent to std::chrono::minutes.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mins | - | the number of minutes |

### Return value

The std::chrono::duration literal.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text constexpr std::chrono::minutes operator""min(unsigned long long m) {     return std::chrono::minutes(m); } constexpr std::chrono::duration<long double,                                 std::ratio<60,1>> operator""min(long double m) {     return std::chrono::duration<long double, ratio<60,1>> (m); } ``` |

### Notes

This operator is declared in the namespace std::literals::chrono_literals, where both literals and chrono_literals are inline namespaces. Access to this operator can be gained with:

- using namespace std::literals,
- using namespace std::chrono_literals, or
- using namespace std::literals::chrono_literals.

In addition, within the namespace std::chrono, the directive using namespace literals::chrono_literals; is provided by the standard library, so that if a programmer uses using namespace std::chrono; to gain access to the classes in the chrono library, the corresponding literal operators become visible as well.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    using namespace std::chrono_literals;
    auto lesson = 45min;
    auto halfmin = 0.5min;
    std::cout << "One lesson is " << lesson.count() << " minutes"
                 " (" << lesson << ")\n"
              << "Half a minute is " << halfmin.count() << " minutes"
                 " (" << halfmin << ")\n";
}

```

Output:

```
One lesson is 45 minutes (45min)
Half a minute is 0.5 minutes (0.5min)

```
