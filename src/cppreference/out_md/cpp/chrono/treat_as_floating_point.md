| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| template< class Rep >   struct treat_as_floating_point : std::is_floating_point<Rep> {}; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

The `std::chrono::treat_as_floating_point` trait helps determine if a duration can be converted to another duration with a different tick period.

Implicit conversions between two durations normally depends on the tick period of the durations. However, implicit conversions can happen regardless of tick period if std::chrono::treat_as_floating_point<Rep>::value is true.

### Helper variable template

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template< class Rep >  constexpr bool treat_as_floating_point_v = treat_as_floating_point<Rep>::value; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

### Specializations

`std::chrono::treat_as_floating_point` may be specialized for program-defined types.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
void timed_piece_of_code() 
{
    std::chrono::milliseconds simulated_work(2);
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(simulated_work);
}
 
int main() 
{
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
 
    std::cout << "Running some timed piece of code...\n";
    timed_piece_of_code();
 
    auto stop = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
 
    // A floating point milliseconds type
    using FpMilliseconds = 
        std::chrono::duration<float, std::chrono::milliseconds::period>;
 
    static_assert(std::chrono::treat_as_floating_point<FpMilliseconds::rep>::value, 
                  "Rep required to be floating point");
 
    // Note that implicit conversion is not allowed here    
    auto i_ms = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(stop - start);
 
    // Note that implicit conversion is allowed here
    auto f_ms = FpMilliseconds(stop - start);
 
    std::cout << "Timing stats:\n";
 
    std::cout << "  Time in milliseconds, using default rep: "
              << i_ms.count() << '\n';
 
    std::cout << "  Time in milliseconds, using floating point rep: "
              << f_ms.count() << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
Running some timed piece of code...
Timing stats:
  Time in milliseconds, using default rep: 2
  Time in milliseconds, using floating point rep: 2.57307

```
