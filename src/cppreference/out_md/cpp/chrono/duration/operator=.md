| duration& operator=( const duration &other ) = default; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Assigns the contents of one `duration` to another.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | `duration` to copy from |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
    std::chrono::hours z_hours{};
    std::chrono::seconds z_seconds{};
 
    z_hours = 2h; // ok, no conversion needed
 
    z_seconds = z_hours;
    // First, the converting ctor is used to create a temporary object of `lhs`s type.
    // This ctor implicitly invokes the casting function
    // chrono::duration_cast<std::seconds>(z_hours). The resulting `rhs` rvalue
    // has the same type as `lhs`, and the `operator=` finally performs the assignment.
 
    std::cout << "hours: " << z_hours.count() << '\n';
    std::cout << "seconds: " << z_seconds.count() << '\n';
 
    z_seconds -= 42s;
 
//  z_hours = z_seconds; // compile-time error (which is good): incompatible types.
    // The library avoids the implicit cast to prevent a potential precision loss.
 
    z_hours = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::hours>(z_seconds); // ok
    z_hours = std::chrono::duration_cast<decltype(z_hours)>(z_seconds);  // ditto
 
    std::cout << "hours: " << z_hours.count() << '\n';
    std::cout << "seconds: " << z_seconds.count() << '\n';
 
    std::chrono::duration<double, std::ratio<3600>> z2_hours{};
 
    z2_hours = z_seconds; // ok, no truncation, implicit cast
 
    std::cout << "hours: " << z2_hours.count() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
hours: 2
seconds: 7200
hours: 1
seconds: 7158
hours: 1.98833

```
