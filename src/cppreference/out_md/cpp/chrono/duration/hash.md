| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| template< class Rep, class Period >  struct hash<std::chrono::duration<Rep, Period>>; |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

The template specialization of std::hash for std::chrono::duration allows users to obtain hashes of objects of type std::chrono::duration<Rep, Period>. This specialization is enabled if and only if both std::hash<Rep> and std::hash<Period> are enabled.
