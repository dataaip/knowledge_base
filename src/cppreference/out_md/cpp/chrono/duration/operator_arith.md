Implements unary plus and unary minus for the durations.

If `rep_` is a member variable holding the number of ticks in a duration object, and `D` is the return type,

1) Equivalent to return D(\*this);.2) Equivalent to return D(-rep_);.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1) A copy of this duration object.2) A copy of this duration object, with the number of ticks negated.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr std::chrono::seconds s1(-052);
    constexpr std::chrono::seconds s2 = -s1;
 
    std::cout << "Negated " << s1 << " are " << s2 << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Negated -42s are 42s

```
