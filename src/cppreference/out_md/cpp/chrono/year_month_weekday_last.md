| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| class year_month_weekday_last; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The class `year_month_weekday_last` represents the last weekday of a specific year and month. It is a field-based time point, with a resolution of std::chrono::days, except that it is limited to pointing to the last weekday of a year and month. std::chrono::years- and std::chrono::months-oriented arithmetic are supported directly. An implicit conversion to std::chrono::sys_days allows std::chrono::days-oriented arithmetic to be performed efficiently.

`year_month_weekday_last` is a TriviallyCopyable StandardLayoutType.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a `year_month_weekday_last`   (public member function) |
| operator+=operator-= | modifies the time point by some number of months or years   (public member function) |
| yearmonthweekdayweekday_last | accesses the fields of this object   (public member function) |
| operator sys_daysoperator local_days | converts to a std::chrono::time_point   (public member function) |
| ok | checks whether this object represents a valid date   (public member function) |

### Nonmember functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator==(C++20) | compares two `year_month_weekday_last` values   (function) |
| operator+operator-(C++20) | adds or subtracts a `year_month_weekday_last` and some number of years or months   (function) |
| operator<<(C++20) | outputs a `year_month_weekday_last` into a stream   (function template) |

### Helper classes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::formatter<std::chrono::year_month_weekday_last>(C++20) | formatting support for `year_month_weekday_last`   (class template specialization) |
| std::hash<std::chrono::year_month_weekday_last>(C++26) | hash support for ****std::chrono::year_month_weekday_last****   (class template specialization) |
