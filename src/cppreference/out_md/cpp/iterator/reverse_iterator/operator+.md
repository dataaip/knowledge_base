| template< class Iter >   reverse_iterator<Iter> operator+      ( typename reverse_iterator<Iter>::difference_type n, const reverse_iterator<Iter>& it ); |  | (constexpr since C++17)  (until C++23) |
| template< class Iter >   constexpr reverse_iterator<Iter> operator+ ( std::iter_difference_t<Iter> n, const reverse_iterator<Iter>& it ); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the iterator it incremented by n. In fact, the underlying iterator is decremented by n.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | - | the number of positions to increment the iterator |
| it | - | the iterator adaptor to increment |

### Return value

reverse_iterator<Iter>(it.base() - n)

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <list>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    {
        std::vector v{0, 1, 2, 3};
        std::reverse_iterator<std::vector<int>::iterator>
            ri1{std::reverse_iterator{v.rbegin()}};
        std::cout << *ri1 << ' '; // 3
        std::reverse_iterator<std::vector<int>::iterator> ri2{2 + ri1};
        std::cout << *ri2 << ' '; // 1
    }
 
    {
        std::list l{5, 6, 7, 8};
        std::reverse_iterator<std::list<int>::iterator>
            ri1{std::reverse_iterator{l.rbegin()}};
        std::cout << *ri1 << '\n'; // 8
    //  auto ri2{2 + ri1}; // Error: the underlying iterator does not
                           //        model random access iterator
    }
}

```

Output:

```
3 1 8

```
