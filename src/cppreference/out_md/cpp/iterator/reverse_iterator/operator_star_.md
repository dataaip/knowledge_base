### Return value

As described above.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    using RI0 = std::reverse_iterator<int*>;
    int a[]{0, 1, 2, 3};
    RI0 r0{std::rbegin(a)};
    std::cout << "*r0 = " << *r0 << '\n';
    *r0 = 42;
    std::cout << "a[3] = " << a[3] << '\n';
 
    using RI1 = std::reverse_iterator<std::vector<int>::iterator>;
    std::vector<int> vi{0, 1, 2, 3};
    RI1 r1{vi.rend() - 2};
    std::cout << "*r1 = " << *r1 << '\n';
 
    using RI2 = std::reverse_iterator<std::vector<std::complex<double>>::iterator>;
    std::vector<std::complex<double>> vc{{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 8}};
    RI2 r2{vc.rbegin() + 1};
    std::cout << "vc[2] = (" << r2->real() << ',' << r2->imag() << ")\n";
}

```

Output:

```
*r0 = 3
a[3] = 42
*r1 = 1
vc[2] = (5,6)

```

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2188 | C++11 | operator-> used `&` to take address | uses std::addressof instead |
