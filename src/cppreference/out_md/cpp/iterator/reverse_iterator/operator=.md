| template< class U >   reverse_iterator& operator=( const reverse_iterator<U>& other ); |  | (constexpr since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Assigns other.`current` to `current`.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_same_v<U, Iter> is false and both std::convertible_to<const U&, Iter> and std::assignable_from<Iter&, const U&> are modeled. | (since C++20) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | iterator adaptor to assign |

### Return value

\*this

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
 
int main()
{
    const int a1[]{0, 1, 2};
    int a2[]{0, 1, 2, 3};
    short a3[]{40, 41, 42};
 
    std::reverse_iterator<const int*> it1{std::crbegin(a1)};
    it1 = std::reverse_iterator<int*>{std::rbegin(a2)};   // OK
//  it1 = std::reverse_iterator<short*>{std::rbegin(a3)}; // Compilation error:
                                                          // incompatible pointer types
    std::reverse_iterator<const short*> it2{nullptr};
    it2 = std::rbegin(a3); // OK
//  it2 = std::begin(a3);  // Compilation error: no viable operator= overload
    std::cout << *it2 << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
42

```
