Increments or decrements the underlying iterator reversely.

| Overload | Equivalent to |

| (1) | --`current`; return \*this; |
| (2) | ++`current`; return \*this; |
| (3) | reverse_iterator tmp = \*this; --`current`; return tmp; |
| (4) | reverse_iterator tmp = \*this; ++`current`; return tmp; |
| (5) | return reverse_iterator(`current`- n); |
| (6) | return reverse_iterator(`current`+ n); |
| (7) | `current`-= n; return \*this; |
| (8) | `current`+= n; return \*this; |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | - | position relative to current location |

### Return value

As described above.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <list>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::vector v{0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    auto rv = std::reverse_iterator{v.rbegin()};
    std::cout << *(++rv) << ' '; // 3
    std::cout << *(--rv) << ' '; // 4
    std::cout << *(rv + 3) << ' '; // 1
    rv += 3;
    std::cout << rv[0] << ' '; // 1
    rv -= 3;
    std::cout << rv[0] << '\n'; // 4
 
    std::list l{5, 6, 7, 8};
    auto rl = std::reverse_iterator{l.rbegin()};
    std::cout << *(++rl) << ' '; // OK: 3
    std::cout << *(--rl) << '\n'; // OK: 4
    // The following statements raise compilation error because the
    // underlying iterator does not model the random access iterator:
//  *(rl + 3) = 13;
//  rl += 3;
//  rl -= 3;
}

```

Output:

```
3 4 1 1 4
7 8

```
