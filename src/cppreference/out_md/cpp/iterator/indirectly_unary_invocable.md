|  |  |  |

The concepts `indirectly_unary_invocable` and `indirectly_regular_unary_invocable` specify requirements for algorithms that call (regular) unary invocables as their arguments. The key difference between these concepts and std::invocable is that they are applied to the type the `I` references, rather than `I` itself.

### Notes

The distinction between `indirectly_unary_invocable` and `indirectly_regular_unary_invocable` is purely semantic.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iterator>
#include <print>
#include <ranges>
 
struct IntWrapper
{
    int i;
 
    explicit IntWrapper(int i) : i(i) {}
    IntWrapper(IntWrapper&&) = default;
    IntWrapper& operator=(IntWrapper&&) = default;
};
 
int main()
{
    auto ints  = std::views::iota(1, 10);
    auto print = [] (IntWrapper w) { std::print("{} ", w.i); };
    auto wrap  = [] (int i) { return IntWrapper{i}; };
 
    using Proj = std::projected<decltype(ints.begin()), decltype(wrap)>;
 
    // error (evaluated to false) until P2609R3:
    // this was because 'std::iter_value_t<Proj> &' is the same as 'IntWrapper&'
    // which is not convertible to 'IntWrapper' (implicitly deleted copy ctor)
    static_assert(std::indirectly_unary_invocable<decltype(print), Proj>);
 
    // if the compile-time check above evaluates to true, then this is well-formed:
    std::ranges::for_each(ints, print, wrap);
}

```

Output:

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P2609R3 | C++20 | some requirements were defined in terms of std::iter_value_t<I>& which mishandled projections resulting in incompatibility with invocable F& | defined in terms of /\*indirect-value-t\*/<I> to correctly handle such projections |
| P2997R1 | C++20 | corresponding concepts required F& to satisfy `invocable` and `regular_invocable`, respectively, with std::iter_common_reference_t<I> | does not require |
