Returns an iterator to the beginning of the given range.

1,2) Returns c.begin(), which is typically an iterator to the beginning of the sequence represented by c.1) If `C` is a standard Container, returns a `C::iterator` object.2) If `C` is a standard Container, returns a `C::const_iterator` object.3) Returns a pointer to the beginning of array.4) Returns std::begin(c), with c always treated as const-qualified. If `C` is a standard Container, returns a `C::const_iterator` object.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c | - | a container or view with a `begin` member function |
| array | - | an array of arbitrary type |

### Return value

1,2) c.begin()3) array4) c.begin()

### Exceptions

4)noexcept specification:noexcept(noexcept(std::begin(c)))

### Overloads

Custom overloads of `begin` may be provided for classes and enumerations that do not expose a suitable `begin()` member function, yet can be iterated. The following overloads are already provided by the standard library:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::begin(std::initializer_list)(C++11) | overloads ****std::begin****   (function template) |
| std::begin(std::valarray)(C++11) | overloads ****std::begin****   (function template) |
| begin(std::filesystem::directory_iterator)end(std::filesystem::directory_iterator)(C++17) | range-based for loop support   (function) |
| begin(std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator)end(std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator) | range-based for loop support   (function) |

Similar to the use of `swap` (described in Swappable), typical use of the `begin` function in generic context is an equivalent of using std::begin; begin(arg);, which allows both the ADL-selected overloads for user-defined types and the standard library function templates to appear in the same overload set.

```
template<typename Container, typename Function>
void for_each(Container&& cont, Function f)
{
    using std::begin;
    auto it = begin(cont);
    using std::end;
    auto end_it = end(cont);
    while (it != end_it)
    {
        f(*it);
        ++it;
    }
}

```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Overloads of `begin` found by argument-dependent lookup can be used to customize the behavior of std::ranges::begin, std::ranges::cbegin, and other customization pointer objects depending on std::ranges::begin. | (since C++20) |

### Notes

The non-array overloads exactly reflect the behavior of `C::begin`. Their effects may be surprising if the member function does not have a reasonable implementation.

`std::cbegin` is introduced for unification of member and non-member range accesses. See also LWG issue 2128.

If `C` is a shallow-const view, `std::cbegin` may return a mutable iterator. Such behavior is unexpected for some users. See also P2276 and P2278.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
Â 
int main() 
{
    std::vector<int> v = {3, 1, 4};
    auto vi = std::begin(v);
    std::cout << std::showpos << *vi << '\n'; 
Â 
    int a[] = {-5, 10, 15};
    auto ai = std::begin(a);
    std::cout << *ai << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
+3
-5

```
