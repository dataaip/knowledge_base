Returns the underlying iterator.

1) Returns a copy of(until C++20)reference to(since C++20) the underlying iterator.2) Returns an iterator move constructed from the underlying iterator.

### Return value

1) `current`2) std::move(`current` ﻿)

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v{0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    std::move_iterator<std::vector<int>::reverse_iterator>
        m1{v.rbegin()},
        m2{v.rend()};
 
    std::copy(m1.base(), m2.base(), std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "));
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
4 3 2 1 0

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3391 | C++20 | overload (1) returned a copy of the underlying iterator | returns a reference |
| LWG 3593 | C++20 | overload (1) was not noexcept | made noexcept |
