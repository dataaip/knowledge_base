|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<wchar.h>` |  |  |
| wchar_t \*wmemchr( const wchar_t \*ptr, wchar_t ch, size_t count ); | (1) | (since C95) |
| /\*QWchar_t\*/ \*wmemchr( /\*Qwchar_t\*/ \*ptr, wchar_t ch, size_t count ); | (2) | (since C23) |
|  |  |  |

1) Locates the first occurrence of wide character ch in the initial count wide characters of the wide character array or integer array of compatible type, pointed to by ptr.2) Type-generic function equivalent to (1). Let `T` be an unqualified wide character object type.

:   - If `ptr` is of type const T\*, the return type is const wchar_t\*.
    - Otherwise, if `ptr` is of type T\*, the return type is wchar_t\*.
    - Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

If a macro definition of each of these generic functions is suppressed to access an actual function (e.g. if (wmemchr) or a function pointer is used), the actual function declaration (1) becomes visible.

If count is zero, the function returns a null pointer.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ptr | - | pointer to the wide character array to be examined |
| ch | - | wide character to search for |
| count | - | number of wide characters to examine |

### Return value

Pointer to the location of the wide character, or a null pointer if no such character is found.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <locale.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    wchar_t str[] = L"诺不轻信，故人不负我\0诺不轻许，故我不负人。";
    size_t sz = sizeof str / sizeof *str;
 
    wchar_t target = L'许';
    wchar_t* result = wmemchr(str, target, sz);
 
    if (result)
    {
        setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
        printf("Found '%lc' at position %td\n",target, result - str);
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
Found '许' at position 14

```
