| int fputws( const wchar_t \*str, FILE \*stream ); |  | (since C95)  (until C99) |
| int fputws( const wchar_t \* restrict str, FILE \* restrict stream ); |  | (since C99) |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

Writes every character from the null-terminated wide string `str` to the output stream `stream`, as if by repeatedly executing fputwc.

The terminating null wide character from `str` is not written.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| str | - | null-terminated wide string to be written |
| stream | - | output stream |

### Return value

On success, returns a non-negative value

On failure, returns EOF and sets the **error** indicator (see ferror) on `stream`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <locale.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    int rc = fputws(L"御休みなさい", stdout);
 
    if (rc == EOF)
       perror("fputws()"); // POSIX requires that errno is set
}

```

Output:

```
御休みなさい

```
