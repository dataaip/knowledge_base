This is a list of reserved keywords in C. Since they are used by the language, these keywords are not available for re-definition. As an exception, they are not considered reserved in attribute-tokens(since C23)

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `alignas` (C23)  `alignof` (C23)  `auto`  `bool` (C23)  `break`  `case`  `char`  `const`  `constexpr` (C23)  `continue`  `default`  `do`  `double`  `else`  `enum` | `extern`  `false` (C23)  `float`  `for`  `goto`  `if`  `inline` (C99)  `int`  `long`  `nullptr` (C23)  `register`  `restrict` (C99)  `return`  `short`  `signed` | `sizeof`  `static`  `static_assert` (C23)  `struct`  `switch`  `thread_local` (C23)  `true` (C23)  `typedef`  `typeof` (C23)  `typeof_unqual` (C23)  `union`  `unsigned`  `void`  `volatile`  `while` | `_Alignas` (C11)(deprecated in C23)  `_Alignof` (C11)(deprecated in C23)  `_Atomic` (C11)  `_BitInt`") (C23)  `_Bool` (C99)(deprecated in C23)  `_Complex` (C99)  `_Decimal128` (C23)  `_Decimal32` (C23)  `_Decimal64` (C23)  `_Generic` (C11)  `_Imaginary` (C99)  `_Noreturn` (C11)(deprecated in C23)  `_Static_assert` (C11)(deprecated in C23)  `_Thread_local` (C11)(deprecated in C23) |

The most common keywords that begin with an underscore are generally used through their convenience macros:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| keyword | used as | defined in |
| `_Alignas` (C11)(deprecated in C23) | alignas (removed in C23) | `stdalign.h` |
| `_Alignof` (C11)(deprecated in C23) | alignof (removed in C23) | `stdalign.h` |
| `_Atomic` (C11) | atomic_bool, atomic_int, ... | `stdatomic.h` |
| `_BitInt`") (C23) | (no macro) |  |
| `_Bool` (C99)(deprecated in C23) | bool (removed in C23) | `stdbool.h` |
| `_Complex` (C99) | complex | `complex.h` |
| `_Decimal128` (C23) | (no macro) |  |
| `_Decimal32` (C23) | (no macro) |  |
| `_Decimal64` (C23) | (no macro) |  |
| `_Generic` (C11) | (no macro) |  |
| `_Imaginary` (C99) | imaginary | `complex.h` |
| `_Noreturn` (C11)(deprecated in C23) | noreturn | `stdnoreturn.h` |
| `_Static_assert` (C11)(deprecated in C23) | static_assert (removed in C23) | `assert.h` |
| `_Thread_local` (C11)(deprecated in C23) | thread_local (removed in C23) | `threads.h` |

Some keywords are deprecated and retained as alternative spellings for compatibility purposes. These can be used wherever the keyword can.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| keyword | alternative spelling |
| `alignas` (C23) | `_Alignas` (C11)(deprecated in C23) |
| `alignof` (C23) | `_Alignof` (C11)(deprecated in C23) |
| `bool` (C23) | `_Bool` (C99)(deprecated in C23) |
| `static_assert` (C23) | `_Static_assert` (C11)(deprecated in C23) |
| `thread_local` (C23) | `_Thread_local` (C11)(deprecated in C23) |

It is unspecified whether any of the spellings of these keywords, their alternate forms, or `true` and `false` is implemented as a predefined macro.

Each name that begins with a double underscore `__` or an underscore `_` followed by an uppercase letter is reserved: see identifier for details.

Note that digraphs `<%`, `%>`, `<:`, `:>`, `%:`, and `%:%:` provide an alternative way to represent standard tokens.

The following tokens are recognized by the preprocessor when they are used **within** the context of a preprocessor directive:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| if  elif  else  endif | ifdef  ifndef  elifdef (C23)  elifndef (C23)  define  undef | include  embed (C23)  line  error  warning (C23)  pragma | defined  __has_include (C23)  __has_embed (C23)  __has_c_attribute (C23) |

The following tokens are recognized by the preprocessor when they are used **outside** the context of a preprocessor directive:

|  |
| --- |
| _Pragma (C99) |

The following additional keywords are classified as extensions and conditionally-supported:

|  |
| --- |
| asm  `fortran` |
