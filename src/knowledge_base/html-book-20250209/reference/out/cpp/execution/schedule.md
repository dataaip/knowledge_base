|  |  |  |

Obtains a sender describing the start of a task graph on the provided scheduler.

For a subexpression sch, the expression schedule(sch) is expression-equivalent to sch.schedule().

### Customization point objects

The name `execution::schedule` denotes a **customization point object**, which is a const function object of a literal `semiregular` class type. The cv-unqualified version of its type is a tag type denoted as `execution::schedule_t`.

All instances of `execution::schedule_t` are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type `execution::schedule_t` on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, `execution::schedule` can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types `Args...`, if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to `execution::schedule` above, `execution::schedule_t` models

- std::invocable<execution::schedule_t, Args...>,
- std::invocable<const execution::schedule_t, Args...>,
- std::invocable<execution::schedule_t&, Args...>, and
- std::invocable<const execution::schedule_t&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of `execution::schedule_t` participates in overload resolution.
