This header was originally in the C standard library as <stddef.h>.

This header is part of the utility library.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Macros | |
| NULL | implementation-defined null pointer constant   (macro constant) |
| offsetof | byte offset from the beginning of a standard-layout type to specified member   (function macro) |
| Types | |
| size_t | unsigned integer type returned by the sizeof operator   (typedef) |
| ptrdiff_t | signed integer type returned when subtracting two pointers   (typedef) |
| nullptr_t(C++11) | the type of the null pointer literal nullptr   (typedef) |
| max_align_t(C++11) | trivial type with alignment requirement as great as any other scalar type   (typedef) |
| byte(C++17) | the byte type   (enum) |
| Functions | |
| to_integer(C++17) | convert std::byte to integer   (function template) |
