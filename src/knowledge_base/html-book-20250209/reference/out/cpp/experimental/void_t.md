|  |  |  |

A utility metafunction that maps a sequence of any types to the type void.

### Notes

This utility metafunction is used in template metaprogramming to detect ill-formed types in SFINAE context. First voted into C++17 as std::void_t, it was later added as well to the library fundamentals TS as `std::experimental::void_t`, because it is a dependency of the detection idiom and the LFTS v2 is based on C++14.
