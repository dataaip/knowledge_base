****Recent milestones: C++23 published, C++26 underway.****

C++23 has been published, and work is now underway on C++26.

Starting in 2012, the committee has transitioned to a "decoupled" model where major pieces of work can progress independently from the Standard itself and be delivered in "feature branch" Technical Specifications (****TS****es). Vendors can choose to implement these, and the community can gain experience with the `std::experimental` version of each feature. This lets us learn and adjust each feature's design based on experience before it is cast in stone when merged into the "trunk" C++ Standard itself. In the meantime, the Standard can be delivered on a more regular cadence with smaller and more predictable batches of features. This approach also helps C++ compilers to track the Standard more closely and add both the experimental and the draft-final C++ features in a more consistent order. The current schedule is in paper P1000.

You can also visit open-std.org to get the latest C++ standards committee papers. Reading through those proposals, you can track the C++ developing trends and know how does a cool idea turned into the standard. However, those papers ****ARE NOT**** and also ****SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS**** the standard documents.
