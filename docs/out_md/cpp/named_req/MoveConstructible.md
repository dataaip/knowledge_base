Specifies that an instance of the type can be constructed from an rvalue argument.

### Requirements

The type `T` satisfies MoveConstructible if

Given

- `rv`, an rvalue expression of type `T`,
- `u`, an arbitrary identifier.

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects.

| Expression | Post-conditions |
| --- | --- |
| T u = rv; | The value of `u` is equivalent to the value of `rv` before the initialization. The new value of `rv` is unspecified. |
| T(rv) | The value of `T(rv)` is equivalent to the value of `rv` before the initialization. The new value of `rv` is unspecified. |

### Notes

A class does not have to implement a move constructor to satisfy this type requirement: a copy constructor that takes a `const T&` argument can bind rvalue expressions.

If a MoveConstructible class implements a move constructor, it may also implement move semantics to take advantage of the fact that the value of `rv` after construction is unspecified.

| Being a MoveConstructible class implies std::is_move_constructible but not vice versa since std::is_move_constructible will only check for the ability to call the constructor with the correct arguments, not a post-condition value. Run this code  ```text #include <iostream> Â  struct S {     int n;     S(int in) : n{in} {}     S(S&& other) { n = other.n + 1; } }; static_assert(std::is_move_constructible_v<S>); Â  int main() {     S v{1};     std::cout << "v.n = " << v.n << '\n';     S u = std::move(v); Â      // Class `S` doesn't satisfy a MoveConstructible requirement     // The value of `u` is NOT equivalent to the value of `v` before the `u` initialization     std::cout << "u.n = " << u.n << '\n'; } ```   Output:   ```text v.n = 1 u.n = 2 ``` |
