Specifies that an object of the type can be copy-constructed in-place by a given allocator.

### Requirements

Given the following types, values and expressions:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `T` | an object type |
| `A` | an allocator type |
| `X` | a container type satisfying all following conditions:  - `X::value_type` is the same as `T`. - `X::allocator_type` is the same as std::allocator_traits<A>::rebind_alloc<T>. |
| Value | Definition |
| m | an lvalue of type `A` |
| p | a pointer of type `T*` |
| Expression | Definition |
| v | an expression denoting an lvalue of type `T` / const T, or an rvalue of type const T |
| expr | std::allocator_traits<A>::construct(m, p, v) |

`T` is CopyInsertable into `X` if all following conditions are satisfied:

- `T` is MoveInsertable into `X`.
- expr is well-formed.
- Evaluating expr does not change the value of v.
- Right after the evaluation of expr, the value of v is equivalent to \*p.

### Notes

If `A` is std::allocator<T>, then this will call placement new, as by ::new((void\*)p) T(v)(until C++20)std::construct_at(p, v)(since C++20).

Although it is required that customized `construct` is used when constructing elements of std::basic_string until C++23, all implementations only used the default mechanism. The requirement is corrected by P1072R10 to match existing practice.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2177 | C++11 | evaluting expr did not have any postcondition | added |
| LWG 3957 | C++11 | v could denote an rvalue of type `T` | excluded |
