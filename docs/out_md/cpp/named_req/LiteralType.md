Specifies that a type is a **literal type**. Literal types are the types of `constexpr` variables and they can be constructed, manipulated, and returned from `constexpr` functions.

Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency.

### Requirements

A literal type is any of the following:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| - possibly cv-qualified void (so that constexpr functions can return void); | (since C++14) |

- scalar type;
- reference type;
- an array of literal type;
- possibly cv-qualified class type that has all of the following properties:

:   - has a trivial(until C++20)constexpr(since C++20) destructor,
    - all of its non-static non-variant data members and base classes are of non-volatile literal types, and
    - is one of

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| - a lambda type, | (since C++17) |

:   :   - an aggregate union type that

        :   - has no variant members, or
            - has at least one variant member of non-volatile literal type,

        - a non-union aggregate type, and each of its anonymous union members

        :   - has no variant members, or
            - has at least one variant member of non-volatile literal type,

        - a type with at least one constexpr (possibly template) constructor that is not a copy or move constructor.

### Notes

A type can be literal even if all of its constexpr constructors are deleted, inaccessible, or cannot participate in overload resolution.

```
struct A { constexpr A(int) = delete; char c; }; // A is a literal type
constexpr A v = std::bit_cast<A>('0'); // OK in C++20
                                       // v has literal type and thus can be constexpr

```

### Example

Literal type that extends string literals:

Run this code

```
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
 
class conststr // conststr is a literal type
{
    const char* p;
    std::size_t sz;
public:
    template<std::size_t N>
    constexpr conststr(const char(&a)[N]) : p(a), sz(N - 1) {}
 
    constexpr char operator[](std::size_t n) const
    {
        return n < sz ? p[n] : throw std::out_of_range("");
    }
 
    constexpr std::size_t size() const { return sz; }
};
 
constexpr std::size_t count_lower(conststr s)
{
    std::size_t c{};
    for (std::size_t n{}; n != s.size(); ++n)
        if ('a' <= s[n] && s[n] <= 'z')
            ++c;
    return c;
}
 
// An output function that requires a compile-time constant N, for testing
template<int N>
struct constN
{
    constN() { std::cout << N << '\n'; }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "The number of lowercase letters in \"Hello, world!\" is ";
    constN<count_lower("Hello, world!")>(); // the string literal is implicitly
                                            // converted to conststr
}

```

Output:

```
The number of lowercase letters in "Hello, world!" is 9

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CWG 1453 | C++11 | a literal class could have volatile data members | not allowed |
| CWG 1951 | C++11 C++14 | it was unclear whether cv-qualified void (C++14) and class types (C++11) are literal types | they are |
| CWG 2096 | C++11 | for a union type to be literal, all its non- static data members must be literal | only one non-static data member needs to be |
| CWG 2598 | C++11 | for a union type to be literal, it must have at least one non-static data member | it can have no non- static data member |
