****BinaryPredicate**** is a set of requirements expected by some of the standard library facilities from the user-provided arguments.

Given a BinaryPredicate `bin_pred` and a pair of iterators `iter1` and `iter2` or an iterator `iter` and a (possibly `const`) value `value`, the type and value category of the expression bin_pred(\*iter1, \*iter2) or, respectively, bin_pred(\*iter, value), must meet the BooleanTestable requirements.

In addition, evaluation of that expression is not allowed to call non-const member functions of the dereferenced iterators; syntactically, the predicate must accept `const` object arguments, with the same behavior regardless of whether its arguments are `const` or non-`const`.

### Requirements

- Predicate
- CopyConstructible (unless otherwise specified)

### Standard library

The following standard library facilities expect a BinaryPredicate which isn't a Compare type.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| unique | removes consecutive duplicate elements   (public member function of `std::forward_list<T,Allocator>`) |
| unique | removes consecutive duplicate elements   (public member function of `std::list<T,Allocator>`) |
| find_end | finds the last sequence of elements in a certain range   (function template) |
| find_first_of | searches for any one of a set of elements   (function template) |
| adjacent_find | finds the first two adjacent items that are equal (or satisfy a given predicate)   (function template) |
| mismatch | finds the first position where two ranges differ   (function template) |
| equal | determines if two sets of elements are the same   (function template) |
| is_permutation(C++11) | determines if a sequence is a permutation of another sequence   (function template) |
| search | searches for the first occurrence of a range of elements   (function template) |
| search_n | searches for the first occurrence of a number consecutive copies of an element in a range   (function template) |
| unique | removes consecutive duplicate elements in a range   (function template) |
| unique_copy | creates a copy of some range of elements that contains no consecutive duplicates   (function template) |
| not2(deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20) | constructs custom std::binary_negate object   (function template) |
| unordered_set(C++11) | collection of unique keys, hashed by keys   (class template) |
| unordered_map(C++11) | collection of key-value pairs, hashed by keys, keys are unique   (class template) |
| unordered_multiset(C++11) | collection of keys, hashed by keys   (class template) |
| unordered_multimap(C++11) | collection of key-value pairs, hashed by keys   (class template) |

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2114 (P2167R3) | C++98 | convertibility of return types to bool was too weak to reflect the expectation of implementations | requirements strengthened |
| LWG 3031 | C++98 | requirements on `const` values were insufficent | requirements strengthened |
