A ****LegacyBidirectionalIterator**** is a LegacyForwardIterator that can be moved in both directions (i.e. incremented and decremented).

If a ****LegacyBidirectionalIterator**** it originates from a Container, then it's `value_type` is the same as the container's, so dereferencing (\*it) obtains the container's `value_type`.

### Requirements

The type `It` satisfies LegacyBidirectionalIterator if

- The type `It` satisfies LegacyForwardIterator

And, given

- a and b, lvalues of type `It`
- `reference`, the type denoted by std::iterator_traits<It>::reference

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects:

| Expression | Return | Equivalent expression | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --a | `It&` |  | Preconditions:  - a is decrementable (there exists such b that a == ++b)   Postconditions:   - a is dereferenceable - --(++a) == a - If --a == --b then a == b - a and --a designate the same iterator object |
| a-- | convertible to const It& | It temp = a;  --a; return temp; |  |
| \*a-- | `reference` |  |  |

A **mutable** LegacyBidirectionalIterator is a LegacyBidirectionalIterator that additionally satisfies the LegacyOutputIterator requirements.

### Notes

The begin iterator is not decrementable and the behavior is undefined if --container.begin() is evaluated.

A bidirectional iterator does not have to be dereferenceable to be decrementable (in particular, the end iterator is not dereferenceable but is decrementable).

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Concept For the definition of std::iterator_traits, the following exposition-only concept is defined.   |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | template<class I>  concept __LegacyBidirectionalIterator =      __LegacyForwardIterator<I> && requires(I i)      {          {  --i } -> std::same_as<I&>;          {  i-- } -> std::convertible_to<const I&>;          { \*i-- } -> std::same_as<std::iter_reference_t<I>>; }; |  |  | |  |  |  |   where the exposition-only concept `__LegacyForwardIterator` is described in LegacyForwardIterator. | (since C++20) |

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 299 (N3066) | C++98 | the return type of \*a-- was required to be convertible to `T` | changed the return type to `reference`[[1]](BidirectionalIterator.html#cite_note-1) |
| LWG 383 | C++98 | b was required to be dereferenceable after --a | a is required to be dereferenceable instead |
| LWG 1212 (N3066) | C++98 | the return type of \*a-- did not match the return type of \*a++ required by LegacyForwardIterator | changed the return type to `reference` |

1. ↑ This issue was initially resolved by N2758 (iterator concepts), which was dropped later from the C++ standard.
