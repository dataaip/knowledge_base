The type must work with `<` operator and the result should have standard semantics.

### Requirements

The type `T` satisfies LessThanComparable if given expressions a, b and c of type `T` or const T(since C++11), the following expression is valid and has its specified effects:

| Expression | Type | Effects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a < b | meets BooleanTestable (until C++20) | Establishes strict weak ordering relation with the following properties:  - For all a, !(a < a) yields true. - If a < b, then !(b < a). - If a < b and b < c, then a < c. - Defining equiv(a, b) as !(a < b) && !(b < a), if equiv(a, b) and equiv(b, c), then equiv(a, c). |
| models `boolean-testable` (since C++20) |

### Notes

To satisfy this requirement, types that do not have built-in comparison operators have to provide a user-defined operator<.

For the types that are both EqualityComparable and LessThanComparable, the C++ standard library makes a distinction between

- **Equality**, which is the value of the expression a == b and
- **Equivalence**, which is the value of the expression !(a < b) && !(b < a).

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2114 (P2167R3) | C++98 | convertibility to bool was too weak to reflect the expectation of implementations | requirements strengthened |
