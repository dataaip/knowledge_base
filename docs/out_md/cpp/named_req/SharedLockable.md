The ****SharedLockable**** requirements describe the minimal characteristics of types that provide shared blocking semantics for execution agents (i.e. threads).

### Requirements

For type `L` to be SharedLockable, the following conditions have to be satisfied for an object `m` of type `L`:

| Expression | Preconditions | Effects | Return value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| m.lock_shared() |  | Blocks until a lock can be obtained for the current execution agent (thread, process, task). If an exception is thrown, no lock is obtained. |  |
| m.try_lock_shared() |  | Attempts to obtain a lock for the current execution agent (thread, process, task) without blocking. If an exception is thrown, no lock is obtained. | true if the lock was obtained, false otherwise |
| m.unlock_shared() | The current execution agent holds a shared lock on `m`. | Releases the shared lock held by the execution agent. Throws no exceptions. |  |

#### Shared locks

A lock on an object is said to be **shared lock** if it is acquired by a call to `lock_shared`, `try_lock_shared`, `try_lock_shared_for`, or `try_lock_shared_until` member function.

### Standard library

The following standard library types satisfy SharedLockable requirements:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| shared_mutex(C++17) | provides shared mutual exclusion facility   (class) |
| shared_timed_mutex(C++14) | provides shared mutual exclusion facility and implements locking with a timeout   (class) |
