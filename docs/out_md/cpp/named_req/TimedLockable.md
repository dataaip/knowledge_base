The ****TimedLockable**** requirements describe the characteristics of types that provide timed exclusive blocking semantics for execution agents (threads, processes, tasks).

### Requirements

- Lockable

For type `L` to be TimedLockable, given

- `rel_time`, a value of a specialization of std::chrono::duration, and
- `abs_time`, a value of a specialization of std::chrono::time_point,

the following conditions have to be satisfied for an object `m` of type `L`:

| Expression | Effects | Return value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| m.try_lock_for(rel_time) | Blocks for the provided duration `rel_time` or until a lock on `m` is acquired. | true if the lock was acquired, false otherwise. |
| m.try_lock_until(abs_time) | Blocks until the provided time point `abs_time` is reached or a lock on `m` is acquired. | true if the lock was acquired, false otherwise. |

### Notes

The `try_lock_for` and `try_lock_until` member functions obtain a non-shared lock on m on success.

### Standard library

The following standard library types satisfy TimedLockable:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| timed_mutex(C++11) | provides mutual exclusion facility which implements locking with a timeout   (class) |
| recursive_timed_mutex(C++11) | provides mutual exclusion facility which can be locked recursively by the same thread and implements locking with a timeout   (class) |
| shared_timed_mutex(C++14) | provides shared mutual exclusion facility and implements locking with a timeout   (class) |
