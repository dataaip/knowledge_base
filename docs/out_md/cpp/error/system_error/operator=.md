std::system_error

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Member functions | | | | |
| system_error::system_error | | | | |
| ****system_error::operator=**** | | | | |
| system_error::code | | | | |
| system_error::what | | | | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| system_error& operator=( const system_error& other ) noexcept; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Assigns the contents with those of other. If \*this and other both have dynamic type `std::system_error` then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | another `system_error` object to assign with |

### Return value

\*this

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <system_error>
 
void print(const std::system_error& e)
{
    std::cout << "code:    [" << e.code() << "]\n"
                 "message: [" << e.code().message() << "]\n"
                 "what:    [" << e.what() << "]\n\n";
}
 
int main()
{
    std::system_error e1(EDOM, std::generic_category(), "Error info #1");
    print(e1);
 
    std::system_error e2(EIO, std::system_category(), "Error info #2");
    print(e2);
 
    e1 = e2;
    assert(std::strcmp(e1.what(), e2.what()) == 0);
    print(e1);
}

```

Possible output:

```
code:    [generic:33]
message: [Numerical argument out of domain]
what:    [Error info #1: Numerical argument out of domain]
 
code:    [system:5]
message: [Input/output error]
what:    [Error info #2: Input/output error]
 
code:    [system:5]
message: [Input/output error]
what:    [Error info #2: Input/output error]

```
