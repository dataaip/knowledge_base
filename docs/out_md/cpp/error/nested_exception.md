| Defined in header `<exception>` |  |  |
| class nested_exception; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

`std::nested_exception` is a polymorphic mixin class which can capture and store the current exception, making it possible to nest exceptions of arbitrary types within each other.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| All member functions of `std::nested_exception` are constexpr. | (since C++26) |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a nested_exception   (public member function) |
| (destructor)[virtual] | destructs a nested exception   (virtual public member function) |
| operator= | replaces the contents of a nested_exception   (public member function) |
| rethrow_nested | throws the stored exception   (public member function) |
| nested_ptr | obtains a pointer to the stored exception   (public member function) |

### Non-member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| throw_with_nested(C++11) | throws its argument with ****std::nested_exception**** mixed in   (function template) |
| rethrow_if_nested(C++11) | throws the exception from a ****std::nested_exception****   (function template) |

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_constexpr_exceptions` | `202411L` | (C++26) | constexpr for exception types |

### Example

Demonstrates construction and recursion through a nested exception object.

Run this code

```
#include <exception>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>
 
// prints the explanatory string of an exception. If the exception is nested,
// recurses to print the explanatory string of the exception it holds
void print_exception(const std::exception& e, int level =  0)
{
    std::cerr << std::string(level, ' ') << "exception: " << e.what() << '\n';
    try
    {
        std::rethrow_if_nested(e);
    }
    catch (const std::exception& nestedException)
    {
        print_exception(nestedException, level + 1);
    }
    catch (...) {}
}
 
// sample function that catches an exception and wraps it in a nested exception
void open_file(const std::string& s)
{
    try
    {
        std::ifstream file(s);
        file.exceptions(std::ios_base::failbit);
    }
    catch (...)
    {
        std::throw_with_nested(std::runtime_error("Couldn't open " + s));
    }
}
 
// sample function that catches an exception and wraps it in a nested exception
void run()
{
    try
    {
        open_file("nonexistent.file");
    }
    catch (...)
    {
        std::throw_with_nested(std::runtime_error("run() failed"));
    }
}
 
// runs the sample function above and prints the caught exception
int main()
{
    try
    {
        run();
    }
    catch (const std::exception& e)
    {
        print_exception(e);
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
exception: run() failed
 exception: Couldn't open nonexistent.file
  exception: basic_ios::clear

```
