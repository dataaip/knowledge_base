| class range_error; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It can be used to report range errors (that is, situations where a result of a computation cannot be represented by the destination type).

The only standard library components that throw this exception are std::wstring_convert::from_bytes and std::wstring_convert::to_bytes.

The mathematical functions in the standard library components do not throw this exception (mathematical functions report range errors as specified in math_errhandling).

Inheritance diagram

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a new `range_error` object with the given message   (public member function) |
| operator= | replaces the `range_error` object   (public member function) |

## std::range_error::range_error

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| range_error( const std::string& what_arg ); | (1) |  |
| range_error( const char\* what_arg ); | (2) |  |
| range_error( const range_error& other ); | (3) | (noexcept since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

1) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg.c_str()) == 0.2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg) == 0.3) Copy constructor. If \*this and other both have dynamic type `std::range_error` then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0. No exception can be thrown from the copy constructor.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| what_arg | - | explanatory string |
| other | - | another exception object to copy |

### Exceptions

1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc.

### Notes

Because copying `std::range_error` is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor taking `std::string&&`: it would have to copy the content anyway.

Before the resolution of LWG issue 254, the non-copy constructor can only accept std::string. It makes dynamic allocation mandatory in order to construct a std::string object.

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by `what()` are the same for the original object and the copied object.

## std::range_error::operator=

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| range_error& operator=( const range_error& other ); |  | (noexcept since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Assigns the contents with those of other. If \*this and other both have dynamic type `std::range_error` then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment. No exception can be thrown from the copy assignment operator.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | another exception object to assign with |

### Return value

\*this

### Notes

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by `what()` are the same for the original object and the copied object.

## Inherited from std::runtime_error

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (destructor)[virtual] | destroys the exception object   (virtual public member function of `std::exception`) |
| what[virtual] | returns an explanatory string   (virtual public member function of `std::exception`) |

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 254 | C++98 | the constructor accepting const char\* was missing | added |
| LWG 471 | C++98 | the explanatory strings of `std::range_error`'s copies were implementation-defined | they are the same as that of the original `std::range_error` object |
