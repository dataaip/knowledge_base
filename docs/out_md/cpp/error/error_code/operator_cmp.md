Compares two error code objects.

1) Compares lhs and rhs for equality.2) Compares lhs and rhs for equality.3) Checks whether lhs is less than rhs.4) Obtains three-way comparison result of lhs and rhs.

| The `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, and `!=` operators are synthesized from operator<=> and operator== respectively. | (since C++20) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | error codes to compare |

### Return value

1) true if the error category and error value compare equal.2) true if the error category or error value compare are not equal.3) true if lhs.category() < rhs.category(). Otherwise, true if lhs.category() == rhs.category() && lhs.value() < rhs.value(). Otherwise, false.4) lhs.category() <=> rhs.category() if it is not std::strong_ordering::equal. Otherwise, lhs.value() <=> rhs.value().
