| Defined in header `<system_error>` |  |  |
| const std::error_category& system_category() noexcept; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Obtains a reference to the static error category object for errors reported by the operating system. The object is required to override the virtual function std::error_category::name() to return a pointer to the string "system". It is also required to override the virtual function std::error_category::default_error_condition() to map the error codes that match POSIX errno values to std::generic_category.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A reference to the static object of unspecified runtime type, derived from std::error_category.

### Notes

On Windows, `system_category()` typically maps some Windows error codes to POSIX ones. On POSIX, `system_category()` tends to be equivalent to std::generic_category() except for the name.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <system_error>
 
int main()
{
    for (int const code : {EDOM, 10001})
    {
        const std::error_condition econd =
            std::system_category().default_error_condition(code);
 
        std::cout << "Category: " << econd.category().name() << '\n'
                  << "Value:    " << econd.value() << '\n'
                  << "Message:  " << econd.message() << "\n\n";
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
Category: generic
Value:    33
Message:  Numerical argument out of domain
 
Category: system
Value:    10001
Message:  Unknown error 10001

```
