`std::terminate_handler` is the function pointer type (pointer to function that takes no arguments and returns void), which is installed and queried by the functions std::set_terminate and std::get_terminate and called by std::terminate.

A `std::terminate_handler` shall terminate execution of the program without returning to the caller, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

The C++ implementation provides a default `std::terminate_handler` function, which calls std::abort(). If the null pointer value is installed (by means of std::set_terminate), the implementation may restore the default handler instead.
