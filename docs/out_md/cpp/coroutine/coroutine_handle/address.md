|  |  |  |

Returns the underlying address of the `coroutine_handle`. The return value is non-null if and only if the current value of the `coroutine_handle` is obtained from a promise object of a coroutine.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The underlying address.

### Notes

The return value is non-null for specialization std::noop_coroutine_handle, because a `std::noop_coroutine_handle` cannot be created without referring to a no-op coroutine.
