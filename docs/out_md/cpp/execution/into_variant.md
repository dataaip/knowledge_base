| Defined in header `<execution>` |  |  |
| execution::sender auto into_variant( execution::sender auto snd ); |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| snd | - | input sender which can send multiple sets of values depending on runtime conditions. |

### Return value

Returns a sender that sends a variant of tuples of all the possible sets of types sent by the input sender. The helper function turns them into a single variant value.
