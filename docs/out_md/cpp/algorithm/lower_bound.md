|  |  |  |

|  |  |  |

Searches for the first element in the partitioned range ``first`,`last`)` which is ****not**** ordered before value.

1) The order is determined by operator<:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Returns the first iterator iter in `[`first`,`last`)` where bool(\*iter < value) is false, or last if no such iter exists.  If the elements elem of `[`first`,`last`)` are not [partitioned with respect to the expression bool(elem < value), the behavior is undefined. | (until C++20) |
| Equivalent to std::lower_bound(first, last, value, std::less{}). | (since C++20) |

2) The order is determined by comp: Returns the first iterator iter in ``first`,`last`)` where bool(comp(\*iter, value)) is false, or last if no such iter exists. If the elements elem of `[`first`,`last`)` are not [partitioned with respect to the expression bool(comp(elem, value)), the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the partitioned range of elements to examine |
| value | - | value to compare the elements to |
| comp | - | binary predicate which returns ​true if the first argument is ordered before the second.   The signature of the predicate function should be equivalent to the following:   bool pred(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);  While the signature does not need to have const &, the function must not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values of type (possibly const) `Type1` and `Type2` regardless of value category (thus, Type1 & is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for `Type1` a move is equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).  The type Type1 must be such that an object of type ForwardIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to Type1. The type Type2 must be such that an object of type T can be implicitly converted to Type2. ​ |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`ForwardIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator. | | |
| -`Compare` must meet the requirements of BinaryPredicate. It is not required to satisfy Compare. | | |

### Return value

Iterator to the first element of the range ``first`,`last`)` not ordered before value, or last if no such element is found.

### Complexity

Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as [std::distance(first, last):

1) At most \(\scriptsize \log_{2}(N)+O(1)\)log2(N)+O(1) comparisons with value using operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since C++20).2) At most \(\scriptsize \log_{2}(N)+O(1)\)log2(N)+O(1) applications of the comparator comp.

However, if `ForwardIt` is not a LegacyRandomAccessIterator, the number of iterator increments is linear in \(\scriptsize N\)N. Notably, std::map, std::multimap, std::set, and std::multiset iterators are not random access, and so their member lower_bound functions should be preferred.

### Possible implementation

See also the implementations in libstdc++ and libc++.

| lower_bound (1) |
| --- |
| ```text template<class ForwardIt, class T = typename std::iterator_traits<ForwardIt>::value_type> ForwardIt lower_bound(ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last, const T& value) {     return std::lower_bound(first, last, value, std::less{}); } ``` |
| lower_bound (2) |
| ```text template<class ForwardIt, class T = typename std::iterator_traits<ForwardIt>::value_type,          class Compare> ForwardIt lower_bound(ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last, const T& value, Compare comp) {     ForwardIt it;     typename std::iterator_traits<ForwardIt>::difference_type count, step;     count = std::distance(first, last);       while (count > 0)     {         it = first;         step = count / 2;         std::advance(it, step);           if (comp(*it, value))         {             first = ++it;             count -= step + 1;         }         else             count = step;     }       return first; } ``` |

### Notes

Although `std::lower_bound` only requires ``first`,`last`)` to be partitioned, this algorithm is usually used in the case where `[`first`,`last`)` is sorted, so that the binary search is valid for any value.

Unlike [std::binary_search, `std::lower_bound` does not require operator< or comp to be asymmetric (i.e., a < b and b < a always have different results). In fact, it does not even require value < \*iter or comp(value, \*iter) to be well-formed for any iterator iter in ``first`,`last`)`.

struct PriceInfo { double price; };
 
int main()
{
    const std::vector<int> data{1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6};
 
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i)
    {
        // Search for first element x such that i ≤ x
        auto lower = std::lower_bound(data.begin(), data.end(), i);
 
        std::cout << i << " ≤ ";
        lower != data.end()
            ? std::cout << *lower << " at index " << std::distance(data.begin(), lower)

    }
 
    std::vector<PriceInfo> prices{{100.0}, {101.5}, {102.5}, {102.5}, {107.3}};
 
    for (const double to_find : {102.5, 110.2})
    {
        auto prc_info = std::lower_bound(prices.begin(), prices.end(), to_find,
            [](const PriceInfo& info, double value)
            {
                return info.price < value;
            });
 
        prc_info != prices.end()
            ? std::cout << prc_info->price << " at index " << prc_info - prices.begin()
            : std::cout << to_find << " not found";
        std::cout << '\n';
    }
 
    using CD = std::complex<double>;
    std::vector<CD> nums{{1, 0}, {2, 2}, {2, 1}, {3, 0}};
    auto cmpz = [](CD x, CD y) { return x.real() < y.real(); };
    #ifdef __cpp_lib_algorithm_default_value_type
        auto it = std::lower_bound(nums.cbegin(), nums.cend(), {2, 0}, cmpz);
    #else
        auto it = std::lower_bound(nums.cbegin(), nums.cend(), CD{2, 0}, cmpz);
    #endif
    assert((*it == CD{2, 2}));

2 ≤ 2 at index 1
3 ≤ 4 at index 2
4 ≤ 4 at index 2
5 ≤ 5 at index 3

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 270 | C++98 | `Compare` was required to satisfy Compare and `T` was required to be LessThanComparable (strict weak ordering required) | only a partitioning is required; heterogeneous comparisons permitted |
| LWG 384 | C++98 | at most \(\scriptsize \log(N)+1\)log(N)+1 comparisons were allowed | corrected to \(\scriptsize \log_{2}(N)+O(1)\)log2(N)+1 |
| LWG 2150 | C++98 | if any iterator iter exists in ``first`,`last`)` such that bool(comp(\*iter, value)) is false, `std::lower_bound` could return any iterator in `[`iter`,`last`)` | no iterator after iter can be returned |
