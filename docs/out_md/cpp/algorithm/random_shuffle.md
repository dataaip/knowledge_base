Reorders the elements in the given range ``first`,`last`)` such that each possible permutation of those elements has equal probability of appearance.

1) The source of randomness is implementation-defined, but the function [std::rand is often used.2) The source of randomness is the function object r. If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

- The return type of r is not convertible to std::iterator_traits<RandomIt>::difference_type.
- Given a positive value n of type std::iterator_traits<RandomIt>::difference_type, the result of r(n) is not a randomly chosen value in the interval ``​0​`,`n`)`.
3) The source of randomness is the object g. Given the type `T` as [std::remove_reference_t<URBG>, if any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

- `T` is not a UniformRandomBitGenerator.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| - `T::result_type` is not convertible to std::iterator_traits<RandomIt>::difference_type. | (until C++20) |

If the type of \*first is not Swappable(until C++11)`RandomIt` is not ValueSwappable(since C++11), the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the range of elements to shuffle randomly |
| r | - | function object returning a randomly chosen value |
| g | - | generator object returning a randomly chosen value |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`RandomIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyRandomAccessIterator. | | |

### Complexity

Exactly std::distance(first, last) - 1 swaps.

### Possible implementation

See also the implementations in libstdc++ and libc++.

| random_shuffle (1) |
| --- |
| ```text template<class RandomIt> void random_shuffle(RandomIt first, RandomIt last) {     typedef typename std::iterator_traits<RandomIt>::difference_type diff_t;       for (diff_t i = last - first - 1; i > 0; --i)     {         using std::swap;         swap(first[i], first[std::rand() % (i + 1)]);         // rand() % (i + 1) is not actually correct, because the generated number is         // not uniformly distributed for most values of i. The correct code would be         // a variation of the C++11 std::uniform_int_distribution implementation.     } } ``` |
| random_shuffle (2) |
| ```text template<class RandomIt, class RandomFunc> void random_shuffle(RandomIt first, RandomIt last, RandomFunc&& r) {     typedef typename std::iterator_traits<RandomIt>::difference_type diff_t;       for (diff_t i = last - first - 1; i > 0; --i)     {         using std::swap;         swap(first[i], first[r(i + 1)]);     } } ``` |
| shuffle (3) |
| ```text template<class RandomIt, class URBG> void shuffle(RandomIt first, RandomIt last, URBG&& g) {     typedef typename std::iterator_traits<RandomIt>::difference_type diff_t;     typedef std::uniform_int_distribution<diff_t> distr_t;     typedef typename distr_t::param_type param_t;       distr_t D;     for (diff_t i = last - first - 1; i > 0; --i)     {         using std::swap;         swap(first[i], first[D(g, param_t(0, i))]);     } } ``` |

### Notes

Note that the implementation is not dictated by the standard, so even if you use exactly the same `RandomFunc` or `URBG` (Uniform Random Number Generator) you may get different results with different standard library implementations.

The reason for removing `std::random_shuffle` in C++17 is that the iterator-only version usually depends on std::rand, which is now also discussed for deprecation. (std::rand should be replaced with the classes of the <random> header, as std::rand is **considered harmful**.) In addition, the iterator-only `std::random_shuffle` version usually depends on a global state. The `std::shuffle`'s shuffle algorithm is the preferred replacement, as it uses a `URBG` as its 3rd parameter.

### Example

Randomly shuffles the sequence `[`1`,`10`]` of integers:

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <random>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
 
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 g(rd());
 
    std::shuffle(v.begin(), v.end(), g);
 
    std::copy(v.begin(), v.end(), std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "));
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
8 6 10 4 2 3 7 1 9 5

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 395 | C++98 | the source of randomness of overload (1) was not specified, and std::rand could not be the source due to the C library requirement | it is implementation-defined, and using std::rand is allowed |
| LWG 552 (N2423) | C++98 | r was not required to be the source of randomness of overload (2)[[1]](random_shuffle.html#cite_note-1) | required |

1. ↑ Overload (3) has the same defect, but that part of the resolution is not applicable to C++98.
