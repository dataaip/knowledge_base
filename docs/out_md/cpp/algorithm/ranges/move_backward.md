1) Moves the elements in the range, defined by ``first`,`last`)`, to another range `[`result - N`,`result`)`, where N = [ranges::distance(first, last). The elements are moved in reverse order (the last element is moved first), but their relative order is preserved. The behavior is undefined if result is within `(first, last]`. In such a case, ranges::move may be used instead.2) Same as (1), but uses r as the source range, as if using ranges::begin(r) as first, and ranges::end(r) as last.

The elements in the **moved-from** range will still contain valid values of the appropriate type, but not necessarily the same values as before the move, as if using \*(result - n) = ranges::iter_move(last - n) for each integer `n`, where 0 ≤ n < N.

The function-like entities described on this page are **algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first | - | the beginning of the range of elements to move |
| last | - | the end of the range of elements to move |
| r | - | the range of the elements to move |
| result | - | the end of the destination range |

### Return value

{last, result - N}.

### Complexity

1) Exactly N move assignments.2) Exactly ranges::distance(r) move assignments.

### Notes

When moving overlapping ranges, ranges::move is appropriate when moving to the left (beginning of the destination range is outside the source range) while ****ranges::move_backward**** is appropriate when moving to the right (end of the destination range is outside the source range).

### Possible implementation

| --- |
| ```text struct move_backward_fn {     template<std::bidirectional_iterator I1, std::sentinel_for<I1> S1,              std::bidirectional_iterator I2>     requires std::indirectly_movable<I1, I2>     constexpr ranges::move_backward_result<I1, I2>         operator()(I1 first, S1 last, I2 result) const     {         auto i {last};         for (; i != first; *--result = ranges::iter_move(--i))         {}         return {std::move(last), std::move(result)};     }       template<ranges::bidirectional_range R, std::bidirectional_iterator I>     requires std::indirectly_movable<ranges::iterator_t<R>, I>     constexpr ranges::move_backward_result<ranges::borrowed_iterator_t<R>, I>         operator()(R&& r, I result) const     {         return (*this)(ranges::begin(r), ranges::end(r), std::move(result));     } };   inline constexpr move_backward_fn move_backward {}; ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
#include <vector>
 
using Vec = std::vector<std::string>;
 
void print(std::string_view rem, Vec const& vec)
{
    std::cout << rem << "[" << vec.size() << "]: ";
    for (const std::string& s : vec)
        std::cout << (s.size() ? s : std::string{"·"}) << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    Vec a{"▁", "▂", "▃", "▄", "▅", "▆", "▇", "█"};
    Vec b(a.size());
 
    print("Before move:\n" "a", a);
    print("b", b);
 
    std::ranges::move_backward(a, b.end());
 
    print("\n" "Move a >> b:\n" "a", a);
    print("b", b);
 
    std::ranges::move_backward(b.begin(), b.end(), a.end());
    print("\n" "Move b >> a:\n" "a", a);
    print("b", b);
 
    std::ranges::move_backward(a.begin(), a.begin()+3, a.end());
    print("\n" "Overlapping move a[0, 3) >> a[5, 8):\n" "a", a);
}

```

Possible output:

```
Before move:
a[8]: ▁ ▂ ▃ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ █
b[8]: · · · · · · · ·
 
Move a >> b:
a[8]: · · · · · · · ·
b[8]: ▁ ▂ ▃ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ █
 
Move b >> a:
a[8]: ▁ ▂ ▃ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ █
b[8]: · · · · · · · ·
 
Overlapping move a[0, 3) >> a[5, 8):
a[8]: · · · ▄ ▅ ▁ ▂ ▃

```
