Merges two consecutive **sorted** ranges ``first`,`middle`)` and `[`middle`,`last`)` into one **sorted** range `[`first`,`last`)`.

A sequence is said to be **sorted** with respect to the comparator comp and projection proj if for any iterator `it` pointing to the sequence and any non-negative integer `n` such that `it + n` is a valid iterator pointing to an element of the sequence, [std::invoke(comp, std::invoke(proj, \*(it + n)), std::invoke(proj, \*it))) evaluates to false.

This merge function is **stable**, which means that for equivalent elements in the original two ranges, the elements from the first range (preserving their original order) precede the elements from the second range (preserving their original order).

1) Elements are compared using the given binary comparison function comp and projection object proj, and the ranges must be sorted with respect to the same.2) Same as (1), but uses r as the range, as if using ranges::begin(r) as first, and ranges::end(r) as last.

The function-like entities described on this page are **algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first | - | the beginning of the first sorted range |
| middle | - | the end of the first range and the beginning of the second range |
| last | - | the end of the second sorted range |
| r | - | the range of elements to merge inplace |
| comp | - | comparison to apply to the projected elements |
| proj | - | projection to apply to the elements in the range |

### Return value

An iterator equal to last.

### Complexity

Exactly N − 1 comparisons, if additional memory buffer is available, where N = ranges::distance(first, last). Otherwise, \(\scriptsize \mathcal{O}(N\cdot\log{(N)})\)𝓞(N•log(N)) comparisons. Additionally, twice as many projections as comparisons in both cases.

### Notes

This function attempts to allocate a temporary buffer. If the allocation fails, the less efficient algorithm is chosen.

| `__cpp_lib_constexpr_algorithms` | `202306L` | (C++26) | constexpr stable sorting |

### Possible implementation

This implementation only shows the slower algorithm used when no additional memory is available. See also the implementation in MSVC STL and libstdc++.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <complex>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
 
void print(auto const& v, auto const& rem, int middle = -1)
{
    for (int i{}; auto n : v)
        std::cout << (i++ == middle ? "│ " : "") << n << ' ';
    std::cout << rem << '\n';
}
 
template<std::random_access_iterator I, std::sentinel_for<I> S>
requires std::sortable<I>
void merge_sort(I first, S last)
{
    if (last - first > 1)
    {
        I middle{first + (last - first) / 2};
        merge_sort(first, middle);
        merge_sort(middle, last);
        std::ranges::inplace_merge(first, middle, last);
    }
}
 
int main()
{
    // custom merge-sort demo
    std::vector v{8, 2, 0, 4, 9, 8, 1, 7, 3};
    print(v, ": before sort");
    merge_sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    print(v, ": after sort\n");
 
    // merging with comparison function object and projection
    using CI = std::complex<int>;
    std::vector<CI> r{{0,1}, {0,2}, {0,3}, {1,1}, {1,2}};
    const auto middle{std::ranges::next(r.begin(), 3)};
    auto comp{std::ranges::less{}};
    auto proj{[](CI z) { return z.imag(); }};
 
    print(r, ": before merge", middle - r.begin());
    std::ranges::inplace_merge(r, middle, comp, proj);
    print(r, ": after merge");
}

```

Output:

```
8 2 0 4 9 8 1 7 3 : before sort
0 1 2 3 4 7 8 8 9 : after sort
 
(0,1) (0,2) (0,3) │ (1,1) (1,2) : before merge
(0,1) (1,1) (0,2) (1,2) (0,3) : after merge

```
