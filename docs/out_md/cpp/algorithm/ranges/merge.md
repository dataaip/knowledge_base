Merges two **sorted** ranges ``[first1`,`last1`)` and `[`first2`,`last2`)` into one **sorted** range beginning at result.

A sequence is said to be **sorted** with respect to the comparator comp if for any iterator `it` pointing to the sequence and any non-negative integer `n` such that `it + n` is a valid iterator pointing to an element of the sequence, [std::invoke(comp, std::invoke(proj2, \*(it + n)), std::invoke(proj1, \*it))) evaluates to false.

1) Elements are compared using the given binary comparison function comp.2) Same as (1), but uses r1 as the first range and r2 as the second range, as if using ranges::begin(r1) as first1, ranges::end(r1) as last1, ranges::begin(r2) as first2, and ranges::end(r2) as last2.

The behavior is undefined if the destination range overlaps either of the input ranges (the input ranges may overlap each other).

This merge function is **stable**, which means that for equivalent elements in the original two ranges, the elements from the first range (preserving their original order) precede the elements from the second range (preserving their original order).

The function-like entities described on this page are **algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first1, last1 | - | the first input sorted range |
| first2, last2 | - | the second input sorted range |
| result | - | the beginning of the output range |
| comp | - | comparison to apply to the projected elements |
| proj1 | - | projection to apply to the elements in the first range |
| proj2 | - | projection to apply to the elements in the second range |

### Return value

{last1, last2, result_last}, where result_last is the end of the constructed range.

### Complexity

At most N − 1 comparisons and applications of each projection, where
N = ranges::distance(first1, last1) + ranges::distance(first2, last12).

### Notes

This algorithm performs a similar task as ranges::set_union does. Both consume two sorted input ranges and produce a sorted output with elements from both inputs. The difference between these two algorithms is with handling values from both input ranges which compare equivalent (see notes on LessThanComparable). If any equivalent values appeared n times in the first range and m times in the second, ****ranges::merge**** would output all n + m occurrences whereas ranges::set_union would output max(n, m) ones only. So ****ranges::merge**** outputs exactly N values and ranges::set_union may produce fewer.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
 
void print(const auto& in1, const auto& in2, auto first, auto last)
{
    std::cout << "{ ";
    for (const auto& e : in1)
        std::cout << e << ' ';
    std::cout << "} +\n{ ";
    for (const auto& e : in2)
        std::cout << e << ' ';
    std::cout << "} =\n{ ";
    while (!(first == last))
        std::cout << *first++ << ' ';
    std::cout << "}\n\n";
}
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> in1, in2, out;
 
    in1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    in2 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    out.resize(in1.size() + in2.size());
    const auto ret = std::ranges::merge(in1, in2, out.begin());
    print(in1, in2, out.begin(), ret.out);
 
    in1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5};
    in2 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    out.clear();
    out.reserve(in1.size() + in2.size());
    std::ranges::merge(in1, in2, std::back_inserter(out));
    print(in1, in2, out.cbegin(), out.cend());
}

```

Output:

```
{ 1 2 3 4 5 } +
{ 3 4 5 6 7 } =
{ 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 7 }
 
{ 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 } +
{ 3 4 5 6 7 } =
{ 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 7 }

```
