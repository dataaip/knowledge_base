|  |  |  |

`ranges::min_max_result` is a class template that provides a way to store two objects or references of the same type as a single unit.

This class template has no base classes or declared members other than those shown below. Thus it is suitable for use with structured bindings.

All special member functions of this class template are implicitly declared, which makes specializations be aggregate classes, and propagate triviality, potentially-throwing-ness, and constexpr-ness of corresponding operations on data members.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T | - | the type of the objects or references that the `ranges::min_max_result` stores. |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member name | Definition |
| min | may be a reference to, a copy of, or an iterator of type `T` to a minimum element in a range.   (public member object) |
| max | may be a reference to, a copy of, or an iterator of type `T` to a maximum element in a range   (public member object) |

All these members are declared with `[[no_unique_address]]` attribute.

### Member functions

## std::ranges::min_max_result::operator min_max_result<T2>

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template<class T2>  requires std::convertible_to<const T&, T2> constexpr operator min_max_result<T2>() const &; | (1) |  |
| template<class T2>  requires std::convertible_to<T, T2> constexpr operator min_max_result<T2>() &&; | (2) |  |
|  |  |  |

Converts \*this to the result by constructing every data member of the result from the corresponding member of \*this.

1) Equivalent to return {min, max};.2) Equivalent to return {std::move(min), std::move(max)};.

### Standard library

The following standard library functions use `ranges::min_max_result` as the return type:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Algorithm functions | |
| ranges::minmax(C++20) | returns the smaller and larger of two elements (algorithm function object) |
| ranges::minmax_element(C++20) | returns the smallest and the largest elements in a range (algorithm function object) |

### Synopsis

```
namespace std::ranges
{
    template<class T>
    struct min_max_result
    {
        [[no_unique_address]] T min;
        [[no_unique_address]] T max;
 
        template<class T2>
        requires std::convertible_to<const T&, T2>
        constexpr operator min_max_result<T2>() const &
        {
            return {min, max};
        }
 
        template<class T2>
        requires std::convertible_to<T, T2>
        constexpr operator min_max_result<T2>() &&
        {
            return {std::move(min), std::move(max)};
        }
    };
}

```

### Notes

Each standard library algorithm that uses this family of return types declares a new alias type, e.g. using merge_result = in_in_out_result<I1, I2, O>;.

The names for such aliases are formed by adding the suffix "**`_result`**" to the algorithm's name. So, the return type of `std::ranges::merge` can be named as `std::ranges::merge_result`.

Unlike std::pair and std::tuple, this class template has data members of meaningful names.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr static auto v = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2};
    {
        constexpr auto result = std::ranges::minmax(v);
        static_assert(1 == result.min && 9 == result.max);
    }
    {
        constexpr auto result = std::ranges::minmax_element(v);
        static_assert(1 == *result.min && 9 == *result.max);
    }
}

```
