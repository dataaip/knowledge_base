1) Returns a view containing all elements equivalent to value in the range ``first`,`last`)`.

The range `[`first`,`last`)` must be at least partially ordered with respect to value, i.e. it must satisfy all of the following requirements:

- partitioned with respect to element < value or comp(element, value) (that is, all elements for which the expression is true precedes all elements for which the expression is false).
- partitioned with respect to !(value < element) or !comp(value, element).
- for all elements, if element < value or comp(element, value) is true then !(value < element) or !comp(value, element) is also true.

A fully-sorted range meets these criteria.

The returned view is constructed from two iterators, one pointing to the first element that is **not less** than value and another pointing to the first element **greater** than value. The first iterator may be alternatively obtained with std::ranges::lower_bound(), the second - with std::ranges::upper_bound().

2) Same as (1), but uses r as the source range, as if using the range [ranges::begin(r) as first and ranges::end(r) as last.

The function-like entities described on this page are **algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the range of elements to examine |
| r | - | the range of the elements to examine |
| value | - | value to compare the elements to |
| comp | - | if the first argument is **less** than (i.e. is ordered before) the second |
| proj | - | projection to apply to the elements |

### Return value

std::ranges::subrange containing a pair of iterators defining the wanted range, the first pointing to the first element that is **not less** than value and the second pointing to the first element **greater** than value.

If there are no elements **not less** than value, the last iterator (iterator that is equal to last or ranges::end(r)) is returned as the first element. Similarly if there are no elements **greater** than value, the last iterator is returned as the second element.

### Complexity

The number of comparisons performed is logarithmic in the distance between first and last (at most 2 \* log2(last - first) + O(1) comparisons). However, for an iterator that does not model `random_access_iterator`, the number of iterator increments is linear.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <compare>
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 
struct S
{
    int number {};
    char name {};
    // note: name is ignored by these comparison operators
    friend bool operator== (const S s1, const S s2) { return s1.number == s2.number; }
    friend auto operator<=>(const S s1, const S s2) { return s1.number <=> s2.number; }
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, S o)
    {
        return os << '{' << o.number << ", '" << o.name << "'}";
    }
};
 
void println(auto rem, const auto& v)
{
    for (std::cout << rem; const auto& e : v)
        std::cout << e << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    // note: not ordered, only partitioned w.r.t. S defined below
    std::vector<S> vec
    {
        {1,'A'}, {2,'B'}, {2,'C'}, {2,'D'}, {4, 'D'}, {4,'G'}, {3,'F'}
    };
 
    const S value{2, '?'};
 
    namespace ranges = std::ranges;
 
    auto a = ranges::equal_range(vec, value);
    println("1. ", a);
 
    auto b = ranges::equal_range(vec.begin(), vec.end(), value);
    println("2. ", b);
 
    auto c = ranges::equal_range(vec, 'D', ranges::less {}, &S::name);
    println("3. ", c);
 
    auto d = ranges::equal_range(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 'D', ranges::less {}, &S::name);
    println("4. ", d);
 
    using CD = std::complex<double>;
    std::vector<CD> nums{{1, 0}, {2, 2}, {2, 1}, {3, 0}, {3, 1}};
    auto cmpz = [](CD x, CD y) { return x.real() < y.real(); };
    #ifdef __cpp_lib_algorithm_default_value_type
        auto p3 = ranges::equal_range(nums, {2, 0}, cmpz);
    #else
        auto p3 = ranges::equal_range(nums, CD{2, 0}, cmpz);
    #endif
    println("5. ", p3);
}

```

Output:

```
1. {2, 'B'} {2, 'C'} {2, 'D'}
2. {2, 'B'} {2, 'C'} {2, 'D'}
3. {2, 'D'} {4, 'D'}
4. {2, 'D'} {4, 'D'}
5. (2,2) (2,1)

```
