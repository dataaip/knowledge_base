| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<memory>` |  |  |
| template< class T, class Alloc >  struct uses_allocator; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

If `T` has a nested type `allocator_type` which is convertible from `Alloc`, the member constant value is true. Otherwise value is false.

### Helper variable template

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template< class T, class Alloc >  constexpr bool uses_allocator_v = uses_allocator<T, Alloc>::value; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| value[static] | true if `T` uses allocator `Alloc`, false otherwise   (public static member constant) |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator bool | converts the object to bool, returns value   (public member function) |
| operator()(C++14) | returns value   (public member function) |

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `value_type` | bool |
| `type` | std::integral_constant<bool, value> |

### Uses-allocator construction

There are three conventions of passing an allocator alloc to a constructor of some type `T`:

- If `T` does not use a compatible allocator (std::uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc> is false), then `alloc` is ignored.
- Otherwise, std::uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc> is true, and

:   - if `T` uses the **leading-allocator convention** (is invocable as T(std::allocator_arg, alloc, args...)), then uses-allocator construction uses this form.
    - if `T` uses the **trailing-allocator convention** (is invocable as T(args..., alloc)), then uses-allocator construction uses this form.
    - Otherwise, the program is ill-formed (this means std::uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc> is true, but the type does not follow either of the two allowed conventions).

- As a special case, std::pair is treated as a uses-allocator type even though `std::uses_allocator` is false for pairs (unlike e.g. std::tuple): see pair-specific overloads of std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator::construct and std::scoped_allocator_adaptor::construct(until C++20)std::uses_allocator_construction_args(since C++20).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The utility functions std::make_obj_using_allocator, and std::uninitialized_construct_using_allocator may be used to explicitly create an object following the above protocol, and std::uses_allocator_construction_args can be used to prepare the argument list that matches the flavor of uses-allocator construction expected by the type. | (since C++20) |

### Specializations

Given a program-defined type `T` that does not have a nested `allocator_type`, a program can specialize `std::uses_allocator` to derive from std::true_type for `T` if any of the following requirements is satisfied:

- `T` has a constructor which takes std::allocator_arg_t as the first argument, and `Alloc` as the second argument.
- `T` has a constructor which takes `Alloc` as the last argument.

In the above, `Alloc` is a type that satisfies Allocator or is a pointer type convertible to std::experimental::pmr::memory_resource\*(library fundamentals TS).

The following specializations are already provided by the standard library:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::uses_allocator<std::tuple>(C++11) | specializes the ****std::uses_allocator**** type trait   (class template specialization) |
| std::uses_allocator<std::queue>(C++11) | specializes the ****std::uses_allocator**** type trait   (class template specialization) |
| std::uses_allocator<std::priority_queue>(C++11) | specializes the ****std::uses_allocator**** type trait   (class template specialization) |
| std::uses_allocator<std::stack>(C++11) | specializes the ****std::uses_allocator**** type trait   (class template specialization) |
| std::uses_allocator<std::flat_map>(C++23) | specializes the ****std::uses_allocator**** type trait   (class template specialization) |
| std::uses_allocator<std::flat_set>(C++23) | specializes the ****std::uses_allocator**** type trait   (class template specialization) |
| std::uses_allocator<std::flat_multimap>(C++23) | specializes the ****std::uses_allocator**** type trait   (class template specialization) |
| std::uses_allocator<std::flat_multiset>(C++23) | specializes the ****std::uses_allocator**** type trait   (class template specialization) |
| std::uses_allocator<std::function>(C++11) (until C++17) | specializes the ****std::uses_allocator**** type trait   (class template specialization) |
| std::uses_allocator<std::promise>(C++11) | specializes the ****std::uses_allocator**** type trait   (class template specialization) |
| std::uses_allocator<std::packaged_task>(C++11) (until C++17) | specializes the ****std::uses_allocator**** type trait   (class template specialization) |

### Notes

This type trait is used by std::tuple, std::scoped_allocator_adaptor, and std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator. It may also be used by custom allocators or wrapper types to determine whether the object or member being constructed is itself capable of using an allocator (e.g. is a container), in which case an allocator should be passed to its constructor.
