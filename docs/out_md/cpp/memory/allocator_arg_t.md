1) `std::allocator_arg_t` is an empty class type used to disambiguate the overloads of constructors and member functions of allocator-aware objects, including std::tuple, std::function, std::packaged_task,(until C++17) and std::promise.2) `std::allocator_arg` is an instance of (1) that can be passed to the constructors and member functions of such permitted types.
