| Defined in header `<memory>` |  |  |
| Call signature |  |  |
| template< no-throw-input-iterator I, no-throw-sentinel-for<I> S >      requires std::destructible<std::iter_value_t<I>> constexpr I destroy( I first, S last ) noexcept; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| template< no-throw-input-range R >      requires std::destructible<ranges::range_value_t<R>> constexpr ranges::borrowed_iterator_t<R> destroy( R&& r ) noexcept; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

1) Destroys the objects in the range ``first`,`last`)`, as if by

```
for (; first != last; ++first)
    std::ranges::destroy_at(std::addressof(*first));
return first;

```

2) Same as (1), but uses r as the source range, as if using [ranges::begin(r) as first and ranges::end(r) as last.

The function-like entities described on this page are **algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | iterator-sentinel pair denoting the range of elements to destroy |
| r | - | the range to destroy |

### Return value

An iterator compares equal to last.

### Complexity

Linear in the distance between first and last.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text struct destroy_fn {     template<no-throw-input-iterator I, no-throw-sentinel-for<I> S>         requires std::destructible<std::iter_value_t<I>>     constexpr I operator()(I first, S last) const noexcept     {         for (; first != last; ++first)             std::ranges::destroy_at(std::addressof(*first));         return first;     }       template<no-throw-input-range R>         requires std::destructible<std::ranges::range_value_t<R>>     constexpr std::ranges::borrowed_iterator_t<R> operator()(R&& r) const noexcept     {         return operator()(std::ranges::begin(r), std::ranges::end(r));     } };   inline constexpr destroy_fn destroy{}; ``` |

### Example

The following example demonstrates how to use `ranges::destroy` to destroy a contiguous sequence of elements.

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <new>
 
struct Tracer
{
    int value;
    ~Tracer() { std::cout << value << " destructed\n"; }
};
 
int main()
{
    alignas(Tracer) unsigned char buffer[sizeof(Tracer) * 8];
 
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i)
        new(buffer + sizeof(Tracer) * i) Tracer{i}; //manually construct objects
 
    auto ptr = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<Tracer*>(buffer));
 
    std::ranges::destroy(ptr, ptr + 8);
}

```

Output:

```
0 destructed
1 destructed
2 destructed
3 destructed
4 destructed
5 destructed
6 destructed
7 destructed

```
