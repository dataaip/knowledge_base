| Defined in header `<memory>` |  |  |
| Call signature |  |  |
| template< std::input_iterator I,  no-throw-forward-iterator O, no-throw-sentinel-for<O> S >      requires std::constructible_from<std::iter_value_t<O>,                                       std::iter_rvalue_reference_t<I>>  uninitialized_move_n_result<I, O>      uninitialized_move_n( I ifirst, std::iter_difference_t<I> count,                           O ofirst, S olast ); | (1) | (since C++20)  (constexpr since C++26) |
| Helper types |  |  |
| template< class I, class O >  using uninitialized_move_n_result = ranges::in_out_result<I, O>; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Let \(\scriptsize N\)N be ranges::min(count, ranges::distance(ofirst, olast)).

Copies \(\scriptsize N\)N elements from the range beginning at ifirst (using move semantics if supported) to an uninitialized memory area ``ofirst`,`olast`)` as if by
auto ret = [ranges::uninitialized_move(std::counted_iterator(std::move(ifirst), count),  
                                      std::default_sentinel, ofirst, olast);  
return {std::move(ret.in).base(), ret.out};

If an exception is thrown during the initialization then the objects that already constructed in ``ofirst`,`olast`)` are destroyed in an unspecified order. Also, the objects in the input range beginning at ifirst, that were already moved, are left in a valid but unspecified state.

If `[`ofirst`,`olast`)` overlaps with ifirst`+``[`​0​`,`count`)`, the behavior is undefined.

The function-like entities described on this page are [**algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ifirst | - | the beginning of the input range of elements to move from |
| ofirst, olast | - | iterator-sentinel pair denoting the output range of elements to initialize |
| n | - | the number of elements to move |

### Return value

As described above.

### Complexity

\(\scriptsize\mathcal{O}(N)\)𝓞(N).

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown on construction of the elements in the destination range.

### Notes

An implementation may improve the efficiency of the `ranges::uninitialized_move_n`, e.g. by using ranges::copy_n, if the value type of the output range is TrivialType.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_raw_memory_algorithms` | `202411L` | (C++26) | constexpr for specialized memory algorithms, (1) |

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text struct uninitialized_move_n_fn {     template<std::input_iterator I,              no-throw-forward-iterator O, no-throw-sentinel-for<O> S>         requires std::constructible_from<std::iter_value_t<O>,                                          std::iter_rvalue_reference_t<I>>     constexpr ranges::uninitialized_move_n_result<I, O>         operator()(I ifirst, std::iter_difference_t<I> count, O ofirst, S olast) const     {         auto iter = std::counted_iterator(std::move(ifirst), count);         auto ret = ranges::uninitialized_move(iter, std::default_sentinel, ofirst, olast);         return {std::move(ret.in).base(), ret.out};     } };   inline constexpr uninitialized_move_n_fn uninitialized_move_n{}; ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
 
void print(auto rem, auto first, auto last)
{
    for (std::cout << rem; first != last; ++first)
        std::cout << std::quoted(*first) << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    std::string in[]{ "No", "Diagnostic", "Required", };
    print("initially, in: ", std::begin(in), std::end(in));
 
    if (
        constexpr auto sz = std::size(in);
        void* out = std::aligned_alloc(alignof(std::string), sizeof(std::string) * sz)
    )
    {
        try
        {
            auto first{static_cast<std::string*>(out)};
            auto last{first + sz};
            std::ranges::uninitialized_move_n(std::begin(in), sz, first, last);
 
            print("after move, in: ", std::begin(in), std::end(in));
            print("after move, out: ", first, last);
 
            std::ranges::destroy(first, last);
        }
        catch (...)
        {
            std::cout << "Exception!\n";
        }
        std::free(out);
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
initially, in: "No" "Diagnostic" "Required"
after move, in: "" "" ""
after move, out: "No" "Diagnostic" "Required"

```
