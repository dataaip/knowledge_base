Constructs a new `polymorphic_allocator`.

1) Constructs a `polymorphic_allocator` using the return value of std::pmr::get_default_resource() as the underlying memory resource.2,3) Constructs a `polymorphic_allocator` using other.resource() as the underlying memory resource.4) Constructs a `polymorphic_allocator` using r as the underlying memory resource. This constructor provides an implicit conversion from std::pmr::memory_resource\*.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | another `polymorphic_allocator` to copy from |
| r | - | pointer to the memory resource to use. May not be null |

### Exceptions

4) Throws nothing.

### Notes

Copying a container using a `polymorphic_allocator` will not call the allocator's copy constructor. Instead, the new container will use the return value of `select_on_container_copy_construction` (a default-constructed `polymorphic_allocator`) as its allocator.
