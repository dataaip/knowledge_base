| Defined in header `<memory>` |  |  |
| template< class T, class... Args >  constexpr T\* construct_at( T\* location, Args&&... args ); |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Creates a `T` object initialized with the arguments in args at given address location.

Equivalent to 
if constexpr (std::is_array_v<T>)  
return ::new (`voidify`â€Šï»¿(\*location)) T[1]();  
else  
return ::new (`voidify`â€Šï»¿(\*location)) T(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
, except that `construct_at` may be used in evaluation of constant expressions(until C++26).

When `construct_at` is called in the evaluation of some constant expression expr, location must point to either a storage obtained by std::allocator<T>::allocate or an object whose lifetime began within the evaluation of expr.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

- std::is_unbounded_array_v<T> is false.
- ::new(std::declval<void\*>()) T(std::declval<Args>()...) is well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand.

If std::is_array_v<T> is true and sizeof...(Args) is nonzero, the program is ill-formed.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| location | - | pointer to the uninitialized storage on which a `T` object will be constructed |
| args... | - | arguments used for initialization |

### Return value

location

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <bit>
#include <memory>
Â 
class S
{
    int x_;
    float y_;
    double z_;
public:
    constexpr S(int x, float y, double z) : x_{x}, y_{y}, z_{z} {}
    [[nodiscard("no side-effects!")]]
    constexpr bool operator==(const S&) const noexcept = default;
};
Â 
consteval bool test()
{
    alignas(S) unsigned char storage[sizeof(S)]{};
    S uninitialized = std::bit_cast<S>(storage);
    std::destroy_at(&uninitialized);
    S* ptr = std::construct_at(std::addressof(uninitialized), 42, 2.71f, 3.14);
    const bool res{*ptr == S{42, 2.71f, 3.14}};
    std::destroy_at(ptr);
    return res;
}
static_assert(test());
Â 
int main() {}

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3436 | C++20 | `construct_at` could not create objects of array types | can value-initialize bounded arrays |
| LWG 3870 | C++20 | `construct_at` could create objects of cv-qualified types | only cv-unqualified types are permitted |
