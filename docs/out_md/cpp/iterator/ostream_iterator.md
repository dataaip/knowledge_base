`std::ostream_iterator` is a single-pass LegacyOutputIterator that writes successive objects of type `T` into the std::basic_ostream object for which it was constructed, using `operator<<`. Optional delimiter string is written to the output stream after every write operation. The write operation is performed when the iterator (whether dereferenced or not) is assigned to. Incrementing the `std::ostream_iterator` is a no-op.

In a typical implementation, the only data members of `std::ostream_iterator` are a pointer to the associated `std::basic_ostream` and a pointer to the first character in the delimiter string.

When writing characters, std::ostreambuf_iterator is more efficient, since it avoids the overhead of constructing and destructing the sentry object once per character.

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member type | Definition |
| `iterator_category` | std::output_iterator_tag |
| `value_type` | void |
| `difference_type` | |  |  | | --- | --- | | void | (until C++20) | | std::ptrdiff_t | (since C++20) | |
| `pointer` | void |
| `reference` | void |
| `char_type` | `CharT` |
| `traits_type` | `Traits` |
| `ostream_type` | std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits> |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member types `iterator_category`, `value_type`, `difference_type`, `pointer` and `reference` are required to be obtained by inheriting from std::iterator<std::output_iterator_tag, void, void, void, void>. | (until C++17) |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a new ostream_iterator   (public member function) |
| (destructor) | destructs an `ostream_iterator`   (public member function) |
| operator= | writes an object to the associated output sequence   (public member function) |
| operator\* | no-op   (public member function) |
| operator++operator++(int) | no-op   (public member function) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <numeric>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
    std::istringstream str("0.11 0.22 0.33 0.44");
 
    std::partial_sum(std::istream_iterator<double>(str),
                     std::istream_iterator<double>(),
                     std::ostream_iterator<double>(std::cout, ", "));
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
0.11, 0.33, 0.66, 1.1,

```
