Returns pointer or reference to the current element, or a proxy holding it.

The behavior is undefined if the underlying std::variant member object `var` does not hold an object of type `I`, i.e. std::holds_alternative<I>(var) is equal to false.

Let `it` denote the iterator of type `I` held by `var`, that is std::get<I>(var).

1,2) Returns the result of dereferencing `it`.3) Returns a pointer or underlying iterator to the current element, or a proxy holding it:

- Equivalent to return it;, if `I` is a pointer type or if the expression it.operator->() is well-formed.
- Otherwise, equivalent to auto&& tmp = \*it; return std::addressof(tmp);, if std::iter_reference_t<I> is a reference type.
- Otherwise, equivalent to return proxy(\*it);, where `proxy` is an exposition only class (4).
 The expression in the `requires`-clause is equivalent to  
std::indirectly_readable<const I> && (  

    requires(const I& i) { i.operator->(); } ||  
    std::is_reference_v<std::iter_reference_t<I>> ||  
    std::constructible_from<std::iter_value_t<I>, std::iter_reference_t<I>>

).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1,2) Reference to the current element, or prvalue temporary. Equivalent to \*it.3) Pointer or iterator to the current element or proxy holding it as described above.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <complex>
#include <initializer_list>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
 
using std::complex_literals::operator""i;
 
int main()
{
    const auto il = {1i, 3.14 + 2i, 3i, 4i, 5i};
 
    using CI = std::common_iterator<
        std::counted_iterator<decltype(il)::iterator>,
        std::default_sentinel_t>;
 
    CI ci{std::counted_iterator{std::next(begin(il), 1), std::ssize(il) - 1}};
 
    std::cout << *ci << ' ' << ci->real() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
(3.14,2) 3.14

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3574 | C++20 | `variant` was fully constexpr (P2231R1) but `common_iterator` was not | also made constexpr |
| LWG 3595 | C++20 | functions of the proxy type lacked constexpr and noexcept | added |
| LWG 3672 | C++20 | `operator->` might return by reference in usual cases | always returns by value |
