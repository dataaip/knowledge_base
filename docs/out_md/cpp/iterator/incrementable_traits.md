Computes the associated difference type of the type `I`, if any. A program may specialize `incrementable_traits` for a program-defined type.

1) Primary template is an empty struct.2) Specialization for pointers. Provides a member type `difference_type` same as std::ptrdiff_t.3) Specialization for const-qualified types.4) Specialization for types that define a public and accessible member type `difference_type`. Provides a member type `difference_type` same as `T::difference_type`.5) Specialization for types that do not define a public and accessible member type `difference_type` but do support subtraction. Provides a member type `difference_type` same as std::make_signed_t<decltype(std::declval<T>() - std::declval<T>())>. The implicit expression variations rule (see below) applies to the expression a - b.

### Implicit expression variations

A requires expression that uses an expression that is non-modifying for some constant lvalue operand also requires implicit expression variations.
