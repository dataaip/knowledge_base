Returns an iterator to the reverse-end of the given range.

1,2) Returns c.rend(), which is typically an iterator one past the reverse-end of the sequence represented by c.1) If `C` is a standard Container, returns a `C::reverse_iterator` object.2) If `C` is a standard Container, returns a `C::const_reverse_iterator` object.3) Returns an std::reverse_iterator<T\*> object to the reverse-end of array.4) Returns an std::reverse_iterator<const T\*> object to the reverse-end of il.5) Returns std::end(c), with c always treated as const-qualified. If `C` is a standard Container, returns a `C::const_reverse_iterator` object.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c | - | a container or view with a `rend` member function |
| array | - | an array of arbitrary type |
| il | - | an std::initializer_list |

### Return value

1,2) c.rend()3) std::reverse_iterator<T\*>(array)4) std::reverse_iterator<const T\*>(il.begin())5) c.rend()

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

### Overloads

Custom overloads of `rend` may be provided for classes and enumerations that do not expose a suitable `rend()` member function, yet can be iterated.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Overloads of `rend` found by argument-dependent lookup can be used to customize the behavior of std::ranges::rend and std::ranges::crend. | (since C++20) |

### Notes

The overload for std::initializer_list is necessary because it does not have a member function `rend`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    int a[]{4, 6, -3, 9, 10};
    std::cout << "C-style array `a` backwards: ";
    std::copy(std::rbegin(a), std::rend(a), std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "));
 
    auto il = {3, 1, 4};
    std::cout << "\nstd::initializer_list `il` backwards: ";
    std::copy(std::rbegin(il), std::rend(il), std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "));
 
    std::vector<int> v{4, 6, -3, 9, 10};
    std::cout << "\nstd::vector `v` backwards: ";
    std::copy(std::rbegin(v), std::rend(v), std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "));
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
C-style array `a` backwards: 10 9 -3 6 4
std::initializer_list `il` backwards: 4 1 3
std::vector `v` backwards: 10 9 -3 6 4

```
