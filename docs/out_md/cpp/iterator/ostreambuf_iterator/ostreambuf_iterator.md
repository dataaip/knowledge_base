1) Constructs the iterator with the private `streambuf_type*` member set to buffer and the failed() flag set to false. The behavior is undefined if buffer is a null pointer.2) Same as ostreambuf_iterator(stream.rdbuf()).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stream | - | the output stream whose `rdbuf()` will be accessed by this iterator |
| buffer | - | the output stream buffer to be accessed by this iterator |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
 
int main()
{
    const char* file = "test.txt";
    {
        std::basic_filebuf<char> f;
        f.open(file, std::ios::out);
        std::ostreambuf_iterator<char> out1(&f);
        *out1 = 'a'; // writes to file via iterator
    }
 
    // read back from the file
    char a;
    std::cout << ((std::ifstream{file} >> a), a) << std::endl;
 
    std::ostreambuf_iterator<wchar_t> out2{std::wcout};
    *out2 = L'b';
}

```

Output:

```
a
b

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 112 | C++98 | the requirement "the argument cannot be null" was applied to overload (2) | applies to overload (1) instead |
| P2325R3 | C++20 | default constructor was provided as C++20 iterators must be `default_initializable` | removed along with the requirement |
