1) Replaces the contents of \*this with a pathname whose both native and generic format representations equal those of p.2) Replaces the contents of \*this with a pathname whose both native and generic format representations equal those of p, possibly using move semantics: p is left in a valid, but unspecified state.3) Replaces the contents of \*this with a new path value constructed from detected-format source, which is left in valid, but unspecified state. Equivalent to assign(std::move(source)).4) Replaces the contents of \*this with a new path value constructed from detected-format source as if by overload (4) of the path constructor. Equivalent to assign(source).

(4) participates in overload resolution only if `Source` and `path` are not the same type, and either:

- `Source` is a specialization of std::basic_string or std::basic_string_view, or
- std::iterator_traits<std::decay_t<Source>>::value_type is valid and denotes a possibly const-qualified encoding character type (char, char8_t, (since C++20)char16_t, char32_t, or wchar_t).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p | - | a path to assign |
| source | - | a std::basic_string, std::basic_string_view, pointer to a null-terminated character/wide character string, or an input iterator that points to a null-terminated character/wide character sequence. The character type must be one of char, char8_t, (since C++20)char16_t, char32_t, wchar_t |

### Return value

\*this

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <filesystem>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
    fs::path p = "C:/users/abcdef/AppData/Local";
    p = p / "Temp"; // move assignment
    const wchar_t* wstr = L"D:/猫.txt";
    p = wstr; // assignment from a source
}

```
