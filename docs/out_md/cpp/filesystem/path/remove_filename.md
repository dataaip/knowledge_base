| path& remove_filename(); |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Removes a single generic-format filename component (as returned by filename) from the given generic-format path.

After this function completes, has_filename returns false.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

\*this

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
    fs::path p;
    std::cout << std::boolalpha
              << (p = "foo/bar").remove_filename() << '\t' << p.has_filename() << '\n'
              << (p = "foo/").remove_filename() << '\t' << p.has_filename() << '\n'
              << (p = "/foo").remove_filename() << '\t' << p.has_filename() << '\n'
              << (p = "/").remove_filename() << '\t' << p.has_filename() << '\n'
              << (p = "").remove_filename() << '\t' << p.has_filename() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
"foo/"  false
"foo/"  false
"/"     false
"/"     false
""      false

```
