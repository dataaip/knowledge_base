| friend path operator/( const path& lhs, const path& rhs ); |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Concatenates two path components using the preferred directory separator if appropriate (see operator/= for details).

Effectively returns path(lhs) /= rhs.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::filesystem::path is an associated class of the arguments. This prevents undesirable conversions in the presence of a using namespace std::filesystem; **using-directive**.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | paths to concatenate |

### Return value

The result of path concatenation.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
#   if defined(_WIN32) // see e.g. stackoverflow.com/questions/142508
 
    std::filesystem::path p = "C:";
 
    std::cout << "\"C:\" / \"Users\" / \"batman\" == " << p / "Users" / "batman" << '\n';
 
#   else // __linux__ etc
 
    std::filesystem::path p = "/home";
 
    std::cout << "\"/home\" / \"tux\" / \".fonts\" == " << p / "tux" / ".fonts" << '\n';
 
#   endif
}

```

Possible output:

```
Windows specific output:
"C:" / "Users" / "batman" == "C:Users\\batman"
 
Linux etc specific output:
"/home" / "tux" / ".fonts" == "/home/tux/.fonts"

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3065 | C++17 | allowed concatenating everything convertible to `path` in the presence of a **using-directive** | made hidden friend |
