| bool empty() const; |  |  |

Checks if the underlying container has no elements. Equivalent to: return`c`.empty().

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the underlying container is empty, false otherwise.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <stack>
 
int main()
{
    std::stack<int> stack;
    assert(stack.empty());
 
    stack.push(42);
    assert(!stack.empty());
 
    stack.pop();
    assert(stack.empty());
}

```
