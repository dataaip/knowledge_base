| Defined in header `<stack>` |  |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template< class T, class Container >  void swap( std::stack<T, Container>& lhs, std::stack<T, Container>& rhs ); |  | (since C++11)  (until C++17) |
| template< class T, class Container >  void swap( std::stack<T, Container>& lhs,             std::stack<T, Container>& rhs ) noexcept(/\* see below \*/); |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

Specializes the std::swap algorithm for std::stack. Swaps the contents of lhs and rhs. Calls lhs.swap(rhs).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_swappable_v<Container> is true. | (since C++17) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | containers whose contents to swap |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Same as swapping the underlying containers.

### Exceptions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| noexcept specification:noexcept(noexcept(lhs.swap(rhs))) | (since C++17) |

### Notes

Although the overloads of std::swap for container adaptors are introduced in C++11, container adaptors can already be swapped by std::swap in C++98. Such calls to std::swap usually have linear time complexity, but better complexity may be provided.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
 
int main()
{
    std::stack<int> alice;
    std::stack<int> bob;
 
    auto print = [](const auto& title, const auto& cont)
    {
        std::cout << title << " size=" << cont.size();
        std::cout << " top=" << cont.top() << '\n';
    };
 
    for (int i = 1; i < 4; ++i)
        alice.push(i);
    for (int i = 7; i < 11; ++i)
        bob.push(i);
 
    // Print state before swap
    print("Alice:", alice);
    print("Bobby:", bob);
 
    std::cout << "-- SWAP\n";
    std::swap(alice, bob);
 
    // Print state after swap
    print("Alice:", alice);
    print("Bobby:", bob);
}

```

Output:

```
Alice: size=3 top=3
Bobby: size=4 top=10
-- SWAP
Alice: size=4 top=10
Bobby: size=3 top=3

```
