| template< class... Args >  std::pair<iterator, bool> emplace( Args&&... args ); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Inserts a new element into the container constructed in-place with the given args, if there is no element with the key in the container.

First, initializes an object t of type `value_type` with std::forward<Args>(args)..., then inserts t as if by

```
auto it = ranges::upper_bound(c, t, compare);
c.insert(it, std::move(t));

```

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_constructible_v<value_type, Args...> is true.

Careful use of `emplace` allows the new element to be constructed while avoiding unnecessary copy or move operations.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| args | - | arguments to forward to the constructor of the element |

### Return value

A pair consisting of an iterator to the inserted element (or to the element that prevented the insertion) and a bool value set to true if and only if the insertion took place.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Complexity

Logarithmic in the size of the container.
