Inserts a new element to the beginning of the container. The element is constructed through std::allocator_traits::construct, which typically uses placement-new to construct the element in-place at the location provided by the container. The arguments args... are forwarded to the constructor as std::forward<Args>(args)....

No iterators or references are invalidated.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| args | - | arguments to forward to the constructor of the element |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`T (the container's element type)` must meet the requirements of EmplaceConstructible. | | |

### Return value

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (none) | (until C++17) |
| A reference to the inserted element. | (since C++17) |

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).
