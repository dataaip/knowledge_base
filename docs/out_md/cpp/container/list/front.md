| reference front(); | (1) |  |

|  |  |  |

Returns a reference to the first element in the container.

Calling `front` on an empty container causes undefined behavior.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Reference to the first element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

For a container `c`, the expression c.front() is equivalent to \*c.begin().

### Example

The following code uses `front` to display the first element of a std::list<char>:

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <list>
 
int main()
{
    std::list<char> letters{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'};
    assert(letters.front() == 'a');
}

```
