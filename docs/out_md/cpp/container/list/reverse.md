| void reverse(); |  | (noexcept since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Reverses the order of the elements in the container. No references or iterators become invalidated.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Linear in the size of the container.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
 
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& ostr, const std::list<int>& list)
{
    for (auto& i : list)
        ostr << ' ' << i;
    return ostr;
}
 
int main()
{
    std::list<int> list = {8, 7, 5, 9, 0, 1, 3, 2, 6, 4};
    std::cout << "initially: " << list << '\n';
 
    list.sort();
    std::cout << "ascending: " << list << '\n';
 
    list.reverse();
    std::cout << "descending:" << list << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
initially:  8 7 5 9 0 1 3 2 6 4
ascending:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
descending: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

```
