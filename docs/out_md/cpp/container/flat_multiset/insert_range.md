| template< container-compatible-range<value_type> R >  void insert_range( R&& rg ); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Inserts a copy of each element in the range rg into underlying container `c` as if by:

```
for (const auto& e : rg)
    c.insert(c.end(), e);

```

Then, sorts the range of newly inserted elements with respect to `compare`.
Merges the resulting sorted range and the sorted range of pre-existing elements into a single sorted range.

Each iterator in the range rg is dereferenced exactly once.
The behavior is undefined if rg overlaps with the container.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rg | - | a container compatible range, that is, an `input_range` whose elements are convertible to `T` |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

N + M·log(M), where `N` is size() before the operation and `M` is ranges::distance(rg).

### Notes

Since `insert_range` performs an in-place merge operation, that may allocate memory.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <flat_set>
 
void println(auto, auto const& container)
{
    for (const auto& elem : container)
        std::cout << elem << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    auto container = std::flat_multiset{1, 3, 2, 4};
    const auto rg = {-1, 3, -2};
#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
    container.insert_range(rg);
#else
    container.insert(rg.begin(), rg.end());
#endif
    println("{}", container);
}

```

Output:

```
-2 -1 1 2 3 3 4

```
