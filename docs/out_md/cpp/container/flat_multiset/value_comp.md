| std::flat_multiset::value_compare value_comp() const; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the function object that compares the values. It is the same as key_comp.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The value comparison function object.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <flat_set>
#include <utility>
 
// Example module 97 key compare function
struct ModCmp
{
    bool operator()(int lhs, int rhs) const
    {
        return (lhs % 97) < (rhs % 97);
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::flat_multiset<int, ModCmp> cont{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
 
    // Same behaviour as key_comp()
    auto comp_func = cont.value_comp();
 
    for (const int val{100}; const int key : cont)
    {
        const bool before = comp_func(key, val);
        const bool after = comp_func(val, key);
 
        std::cout << "Key (" << key << ") ";
        if (!before && !after)
            std::cout << "equivalent to key (" << val << ")\n";
        else if (before)
            std::cout << "goes before key (" << val << ")\n";
        else if (after)
            std::cout << "goes after key (" << val << ")\n";
        else
            std::unreachable();
    }
}

```

Output:

```
Key (1) goes before key (100)
Key (2) goes before key (100)
Key (3) equivalent to key (100)
Key (4) goes after key (100)
Key (5) goes after key (100)

```
