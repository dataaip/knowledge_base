| Defined in header `<inplace_vector>` |  |  |
| constexpr friend void swap( std::inplace_vector& lhs,                              std::inplace_vector& rhs ) noexcept(/\* see below \*/); |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

Specializes the std::swap algorithm for std::inplace_vector. Swaps the contents of lhs and rhs. Calls lhs.swap(rhs).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | containers whose contents to swap |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Linear in size of the containers.

### Exceptions

noexcept specification:noexcept(N == 0 ||  
         (std::is_nothrow_swappable_v<T> && std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>))

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <inplace_vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::inplace_vector<int, 4> alice{1, 2, 3};
    std::inplace_vector<int, 4> bob{7, 8, 9, 10};
 
    auto print = [](const int& n) { std::cout << ' ' << n; };
 
    // Print state before swap
    std::cout << "Alice:";
    std::for_each(alice.begin(), alice.end(), print);
    std::cout << "\nBobby:";
    std::for_each(bob.begin(), bob.end(), print);
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    std::cout << "-- SWAP\n";
    std::swap(alice, bob);
 
    // Print state after swap
    std::cout << "Alice:";
    std::for_each(alice.begin(), alice.end(), print);
    std::cout << "\nBobby:";
    std::for_each(bob.begin(), bob.end(), print);
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Alice: 1 2 3
Bobby: 7 8 9 10
-- SWAP
Alice: 7 8 9 10
Bobby: 1 2 3

```
