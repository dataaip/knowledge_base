| constexpr reference operator[]( size_type pos ); | (1) | (since C++26) |
| constexpr const_reference operator[]( size_type pos ) const; | (2) | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

Returns a reference to the element at specified location pos. No bounds checking is performed.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | - | position of the element to return |

### Return value

Reference to the requested element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

Unlike [std::map::operator[]](../map/operator_at.html "cpp/container/map/operator at"), this operator never inserts a new element into the container. Accessing a nonexistent element through this operator is undefined behavior.

### Example

The following code uses operator[] to read from and write to a std::inplace_vector<int, N>:

Run this code

```
#include <inplace_vector>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::inplace_vector<int, 4> numbers{2, 4, 6, 8};
 
    std::cout << "Second element: " << numbers[1] << '\n';
 
    numbers[0] = 5;
 
    std::cout << "All numbers:";
    for (auto i : numbers)
        std::cout << ' ' << i;
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Second element: 4
All numbers: 5 4 6 8

```
