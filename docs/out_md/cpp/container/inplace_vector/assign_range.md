| template< container-compatible-range<T> R >  constexpr void assign_range( R&& rg ); |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

Replaces elements in the container with a copy of each element in rg.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | This section is incomplete |

Each iterator in the range rg is dereferenced exactly once.

The behavior is undefined if rg overlaps with the container.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rg | - | an `input_range` with reference type convertible to the element type of the container |
| Type requirements | | |
| -std::assignable_from<T&, ranges::range_reference_t<R>> must be modeled. Otherwise, the program is ill-formed. | | |
| -`T` must be EmplaceConstructible into the container from \*ranges::begin(rg). Otherwise, the behavior is undefined. | | |

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

- bad_alloc, if std::ranges::distance(rg) > capacity().
- Any exception thrown by initialization of inserted element.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <initializer_list>
#include <inplace_vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <new>
 
int main()
{
    const auto source = {1, 2, 3};
    std::inplace_vector<int, 4> destination{4, 5};
    destination.assign_range(source);
    assert(std::ranges::equal(destination, source));
 
    try
    {
        const auto bad = {-1, -2, -3, -4, -5};
        destination.assign_range(bad); // throws: bad.size() > destination.capacity()
    }
    catch(const std::bad_alloc& ex)
    {
        std::cout << ex.what() << '\n';
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
std::bad_alloc

```
