Checks if the container has no elements, i.e. whether begin() == end().

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the container is empty, false otherwise.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <inplace_vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::inplace_vector<char, 8> v;
    assert(v.empty());
 
    v.push_back('_');
    assert(not v.empty());
}

```
