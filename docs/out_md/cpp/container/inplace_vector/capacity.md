| static constexpr size_type capacity() noexcept; |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the capacity of the internal (inplace) storage. Equivalent to: return N;.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The maximum number of elements the container is able to hold.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

Because each std::inplace_vector<T, N> is a fixed-capacity container, the value returned by `capacity` equals `N` (which is also the value returned by max_size()).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <inplace_vector>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr std::inplace_vector<int, 4> v1;
    static_assert(v1.capacity() == 4 && v1.max_size() == 4);
 
    constexpr std::inplace_vector<int, 0> v2;
    static_assert(v2.capacity() == 0 && v2.max_size() == 0);
}

```
