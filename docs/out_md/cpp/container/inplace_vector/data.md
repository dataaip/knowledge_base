Returns a pointer to the underlying array serving as element storage. The pointer is such that range ``data()`,`data() +size()`)` is always a [valid range, even if the container is empty (`data()` is not dereferenceable in that case).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Pointer to the underlying element storage. For non-empty containers, the returned pointer compares equal to the address of the first element, that is data() == std::addressof(front()) is true.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

If size() is ​0​, `data()` may or may not return a null pointer.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
#include <span>
#include <inplace_vector>
 
void pointer_func(const int* p, std::size_t size)
{
    std::cout << "data = ";
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i)
        std::cout << p[i] << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
void span_func(std::span<const int> data) // since C++20
{
    std::cout << "data = ";
    for (const int e : data)
        std::cout << e << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    std::inplace_vector<int, 4> container{1, 2, 3, 4};
 
    // Prefer container.data() over &container[0]
    pointer_func(container.data(), container.size());
 
    // std::span is a safer alternative to separated pointer/size.
    span_func({container.data(), container.size()});
}

```

Output:

```
data = 1 2 3 4
data = 1 2 3 4

```
