|  |  |  |

Does nothing.

Nominally, this function is a non-binding request to decrease capacity so that the internal storage contains only size() elements. However, such a request is always ignored by the fixed-capacity container std::inplace_vector<T, N>.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

This function exists for compatibility with vector-like interfaces.
