Returns a reference to the last element in the container.

Calling `back` on an empty container causes undefined behavior.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Reference to the last element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

For a non-empty container `c`, the expression c.back() is equivalent to \*std::prev(c.end()).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <inplace_vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::inplace_vector<char, 4> letters{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'};
    assert(letters.back() == 'd');
}

```
