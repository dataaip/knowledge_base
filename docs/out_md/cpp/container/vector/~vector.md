| ~vector(); |  | (constexpr since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

A destructor.
Destructs the `vector`. The destructors of the elements are called and the used storage is deallocated. Note, that if the elements are pointers, the pointed-to objects are not destroyed.

### Complexity

Linear in the size of the `vector`.
