| void push_back( const T& value ); | (1) | (constexpr since C++20) |
| void push_back( T&& value ); | (2) | (since C++11)  (constexpr since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Appends the given element value to the end of the container.

1) The new element is initialized as a copy of value.2) value is moved into the new element.

If after the operation the new `size()` is greater than old `capacity()` a reallocation takes place, in which case all iterators (including the `end()` iterator) and all references to the elements are invalidated. Otherwise only the `end()` iterator is invalidated.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | - | the value of the element to append |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`T` must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload (1). | | |
| -`T` must meet the requirements of MoveInsertable in order to use overload (2). | | |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Amortized constant.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown (which can be due to `Allocator::allocate()` or element copy/move constructor/assignment), this function has no effect (strong exception guarantee).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| If the move constructor of `T` is not noexcept and `T` is not CopyInsertable into \*this, vector will use the throwing move constructor. If it throws, the guarantee is waived and the effects are unspecified. | (since C++11) |

### Notes

Some implementations throw std::length_error when `push_back` causes a reallocation that exceeds max_size (due to an implicit call to an equivalent of reserve`(`size`() + 1))`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<std::string> letters;
 
    letters.push_back("abc");
    std::string s{"def"};
    letters.push_back(std::move(s));
 
    std::cout << "std::vector letters holds: ";
    for (auto&& e : letters)
        std::cout << std::quoted(e) << ' ';
 
    std::cout << "\nMoved-from string s holds: " << std::quoted(s) << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
std::vector letters holds: "abc" "def"
Moved-from string s holds: ""

```
