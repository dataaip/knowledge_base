| Defined in header `<inplace_vector>` |  |  |
| template<  class T,  ¬† ¬† std::size_t N > struct inplace_vector; |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

`inplace_vector` is a dynamically-resizable array with contiguous inplace storage. The elements of type `T` are stored and properly aligned within the object itself. The capacity of the internal storage is fixed at compile-time and is equal to N.

The elements are stored contiguously, which means that elements can be accessed not only through iterators or random-access operator[], but also using offsets to regular pointers to elements. A pointer to an element of an `inplace_vector` may be passed to any function that expects a pointer to an element of a C-array.

The `inplace_vector` models Container, ReversibleContainer, ContiguousContainer, and SequenceContainer, including most of the optional sequence container requirements, except that the `push_front`, `emplace_front`, `pop_front`, and `prepend_range` member functions are not provided.

For any positive N, `std::inplace_vector<T, N>::iterator` and `std::inplace_vector<T, N>::const_iterator` meet the ConstexprIterator requirements.

For any positive N, if `T` is not TriviallyCopyable or std::is_trivially_default_constructible_v<T> is false, then member functions of `inplace_vector` are not usable in constant expressions.

The specialization std::inplace_vector<T, 0> is TriviallyCopyable and is empty. std::is_trivially_default_constructible_v<std::inplace_vector<T, 0>> is also true.

Any member function of std::inplace_vector<T, N> that would cause insertion beyond the capacity N throws std::bad_alloc.

The complexity of common operations on `inplace_vector`s is as follows:

- Random access to an element via [`operator[]`](inplace_vector/operator_at.html "cpp/container/inplace vector/operator at") or `at()` ‚Äì constant: ùìû(1).
- Insertion or removal of an element at the end ‚Äì constant: ùìû(1).
- Insertion or removal of elements at the end ‚Äì linear in the number of elements inserted/removed: ùìû(n).
- Insertion or removal of elements in the beginning or in the middle ‚Äì linear in the number of elements inserted/removed plus the distance to the end of the vector: ùìû(n).

### Iterator invalidation

`std::inplace_vector` iterator invalidation guarantees differ from std::vector:

- moving an `inplace_vector` invalidates all iterators;
- swapping two `inplace_vector`s invalidates all iterators (during swap, the iterator will continue to point to the same array element, and may thus change its value).

The following member functions potentially invalidate iterators:
`operator=`,
`assign`,
`assign_range`,
`clear`,
`emplace`,
`erase`,
`insert`,
`insert_range`,
`pop_back`,
`resize`, and
`swap`.

The following member functions potentially invalidate `end` iterator only:
`append_range`,
`emplace_back`,
`push_back`,
`try_append_range`,
`try_emplace_back`,
`try_push_back`,
`unchecked_emplace_back`, and
`unchecked_push_back`.

| operator==operator<=>(C++26) | lexicographically compares the values of two `inplace_vector`s   (function template) |

### Notes

The number of elements in a `inplace_vector` may vary dynamically up to a fixed capacity because elements are stored within the object itself similarly to std::array. However, objects are initialized as they are inserted into `inplace_vector` unlike C arrays or std::array , which must construct all elements on instantiation.

`inplace_vector` is useful in environments where dynamic memory allocations are undesired.

    assert(v1.size() == 4);
    v1.clear();
    assert(v1.size() == 0);
    assert(v1.empty());
}
