Returns a reference to the mapped value of the element with specified key. If no such element exists, an exception of type std::out_of_range is thrown.

1,2) The key is equivalent to key.3,4) The key compares **equivalent** to the value x. The reference to the mapped value is obtained as if by expression this->find(x)->second. The expression this->find(x) must be well-formed and have well-defined behavior, otherwise the behavior is undefined. These overloads participate in overload resolution only if Hash::is_transparent and KeyEqual::is_transparent are valid and each denotes a type. This assumes that such `Hash` is callable with both `K` and `Key` type, and that the `KeyEqual` is transparent, which, together, allows calling this function without constructing an instance of `Key`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| key | - | the key of the element to find |
| x | - | a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key |

### Return value

A reference to the mapped value of the requested element.

### Exceptions

1,2) std::out_of_range if the container does not have an element with the specified key.3,4) std::out_of_range if the container does not have the specified element, that is, if find(x) == end() is true.

### Complexity

Average case: constant, worst case: linear in size.
