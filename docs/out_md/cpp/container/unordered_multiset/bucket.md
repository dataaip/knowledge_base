| size_type bucket( const Key& key ) const; | (1) | (since C++11) |
| template< typename K >  size_type bucket( const K& x ) const; | (2) | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

1) Returns the index of the bucket for key key. Elements (if any) with keys equivalent to key are always found in this bucket.2) Returns the index of the bucket for key that compares **equivalent** to the value x. Elements (if any) with keys that compare equivalent to x are always found in this bucket. This overload participates in overload resolution only if Hash::is_transparent and KeyEqual::is_transparent are valid and each denotes a type. This assumes that such `Hash` is callable with both `K` and `Key` type, and that the `KeyEqual` is transparent, which, together, allows calling this function without constructing an instance of `Key`.

The returned value is valid only for instances of the container for which bucket_count() returns the same value (e.g., rehash() invalidates previously obtained value).

The behavior is undefined if bucket_count() is zero.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| key | - | the value of the key to examine |
| x | - | a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key |

### Return value

Bucket index for the requested key.

### Complexity

Constant.
