|  |  |  |

Attempts to extract ("splice") each element in source and insert it into \*this using the comparison object of \*this.

No elements are copied or moved, only the internal pointers of the container nodes are repointed. All pointers and references to the transferred elements remain valid, but now refer into \*this, not into source.

The behavior is undefined if get_allocator() != source.get_allocator().

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| source | - | compatible container to transfer the nodes from |

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

Does not throw unless comparison throws.

### Complexity

N \* log(size() + N)), where N is source.size().

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
 
// print out a container
template<class Os, class K>
Os& operator<<(Os& os, const std::multiset<K>& v)
{
    os << '[' << v.size() << "] {";
    bool o{};
    for (const auto& e : v)
        os << (o ? ", " : (o = 1, " ")) << e;
    return os << " }\n";
}
 
int main()
{
    std::multiset<char>
        p{'C', 'B', 'B', 'A'}, 
        q{'E', 'D', 'E', 'C'};
 
    std::cout << "p: " << p << "q: " << q;
 
    p.merge(q);
 
    std::cout << "p.merge(q);\n" << "p: " << p << "q: " << q;
}

```

Output:

```
p: [4] { A, B, B, C }
q: [4] { C, D, E, E }
p.merge(q);
p: [8] { A, B, B, C, C, D, E, E }
q: [0] { }

```
