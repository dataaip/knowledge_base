| size_type max_size() const; |  | (noexcept since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the maximum number of elements the container is able to hold due to system or library implementation limitations, i.e. std::distance(begin(), end()) for the largest container.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Maximum number of elements.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

This value typically reflects the theoretical limit on the size of the container, at most std::numeric_limits<difference_type>::max(). At runtime, the size of the container may be limited to a value smaller than `max_size()` by the amount of RAM available.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <set>
 
int main()
{
    std::multiset<char> p;
    std::multiset<long> q;
 
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
    std::cout << std::uppercase
              << "p.max_size() = " << std::dec << p.max_size() << " = 0x"
              << std::hex << p.max_size() << '\n'
              << "q.max_size() = " << std::dec << q.max_size() << " = 0x"
              << std::hex << q.max_size() << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
p.max_size() = 461,168,601,842,738,790 = 0x666,666,666,666,666
q.max_size() = 461,168,601,842,738,790 = 0x666,666,666,666,666

```
