Returns an iterator to the first element of the `multiset`.

If the `multiset` is empty, the returned iterator will be equal to end().

!range-begin-end.svg

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Iterator to the first element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

Because both `iterator` and `const_iterator` are constant iterators (and may in fact be the same type), it is not possible to mutate the elements of the container through an iterator returned by any of these member functions.

libc++ backports `cbegin()` to C++98 mode.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <set>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    const std::multiset<std::string> words =
    {
        "some", "not", "sorted", "words",
        "will", "come", "out", "sorted",
    };
 
    for (auto it = words.begin(); it != words.end(); )
    {
        auto count = words.count(*it);
        std::cout << *it << ":\t" << count << '\n';
        std::advance(it, count); // all count elements have equivalent keys
    }
}

```

Output:

```
come:	1
not:	1
out:	1
some:	1
sorted:	2
will:	1
words:	1

```
