Returns the number of elements in the container, i.e. std::distance(begin(), end()).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The number of elements in the container.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <set>
 
int main()
{
    std::multiset<int> nums{4, 2, 4, 2};
    assert(nums.size() == 4);
}

```
