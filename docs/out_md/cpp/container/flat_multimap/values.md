| const mapped_container_type& values() const noexcept; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Return a constant reference to the adapted values container. Equivalent to return c.values;.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The underlying values container.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <flat_map>
#include <print>
#include <type_traits>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::flat_multimap<int, double> map{{1, 1.1}, {2, 2.2}, {3, 3.3}};
 
    // The default values container is std::vector:
    static_assert(std::is_same_v<decltype(map.values()), const std::vector<int>&>);
 
    std::println("{}", map.values());
}

```

Output:

```
[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]

```
