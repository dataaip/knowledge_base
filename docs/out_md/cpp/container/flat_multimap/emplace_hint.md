| template< class... Args >  iterator emplace_hint( const_iterator hint, Args&&... args ); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Inserts a new element into the container as close as possible to the position just before hint.

The constructor of the element type (`value_type`, that is, std::pair<const Key, T>) is called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to the function, forwarded with std::forward<Args>(args)....

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hint | - | iterator to the position before which the new element will be inserted |
| args | - | arguments to forward to the constructor of the element |

### Return value

An iterator to the inserted element.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).
