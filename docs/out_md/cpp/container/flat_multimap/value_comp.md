| std::flat_multimap::value_compare value_comp() const; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Returns a function object that compares objects of type std::flat_multimap::`value_type` (key-value pairs) by using key_comp to compare the first components of the pairs.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The value comparison function object.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <flat_map>
#include <utility>
 
// Example module 97 key compare function
struct ModCmp
{
    bool operator()(int lhs, int rhs) const
    {
        return (lhs % 97) < (rhs % 97);
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::flat_multimap<int, char, ModCmp> cont;
    cont = {{1, 'a'}, {2, 'b'}, {3, 'c'}, {4, 'd'}, {5, 'e'}};
 
    auto comp_func = cont.value_comp();
 
    for (const std::pair<int, char> val = {100, 'a'}; auto it : cont)
    {
        const bool before = comp_func(it, val);
        const bool after = comp_func(val, it);
 
        std::cout << '(' << it.first << ',' << it.second << ") ";
        if (!before && !after)
            std::cout << "equivalent to key (" << val.first << ")\n";
        else if (before)
            std::cout << "goes before key (" << val.first << ")\n";
        else if (after)
            std::cout << "goes after key (" << val.first << ")\n";
        else
            std::unreachable();
    }
}

```

Output:

```
(1,a) goes before key (100)
(2,b) goes before key (100)
(3,c) equivalent to key (100)
(4,d) goes after key (100)
(5,e) goes after key (100)

```
