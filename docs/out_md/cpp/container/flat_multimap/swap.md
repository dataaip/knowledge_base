| void swap( flat_multimap& other ) noexcept; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Exchanges the contents of the container adaptor with those of `other`. Effectively calls

```
ranges::swap(compare, other.compare);
ranges::swap(c.keys, other.c.keys);
ranges::swap(c.values, other.c.values);

```

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | container adaptor to exchange the contents with |

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

(none)

### Complexity

Same as underlying container (typically constant).
