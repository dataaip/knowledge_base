`std::multiset` is an associative container that contains a sorted set of objects of type Key. Unlike set, multiple keys with equivalent values are allowed. Sorting is done using the key comparison function Compare. Search, insertion, and removal operations have logarithmic complexity.

Everywhere the standard library uses the Compare requirements, equivalence is determined by using the equivalence relation as described on Compare. In imprecise terms, two objects a and b are considered equivalent if neither compares less than the other: !comp(a, b) && !comp(b, a).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The order of the elements that compare equivalent is the order of insertion and does not change. | (since C++11) |

`std::multiset` meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer, AssociativeContainer and ReversibleContainer.

### Notes

The member types `iterator` and `const_iterator` may be aliases to the same type. This means defining a pair of function overloads using the two types as parameter types may violate the One Definition Rule. Since `iterator` is convertible to `const_iterator`, a single function with a `const_iterator` as parameter type will work instead.

| LWG 103 | C++98 | iterator allows modification of keys | iterator made constant |
| LWG 230 | C++98 | `Key` was not required to be CopyConstructible (a key of type `Key` might not be able to be constructed) | `Key` is also required to be CopyConstructible |
