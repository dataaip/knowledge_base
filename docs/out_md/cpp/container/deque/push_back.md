| void push_back( const T& value ); | (1) |  |
| void push_back( T&& value ); | (2) | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Appends the given element value to the end of the container.

1) The new element is initialized as a copy of value.2) value is moved into the new element.

All iterators (including the `end()` iterator) are invalidated. No references are invalidated.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | - | the value of the element to append |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`T` must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload (1). | | |
| -`T` must meet the requirements of MoveInsertable in order to use overload (2). | | |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown (which can be due to `Allocator::allocate()` or element copy/move constructor/assignment), this function has no effect (strong exception guarantee).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <deque>
 
int main()
{
    std::deque<std::string> letters;
 
    letters.push_back("abc");
    std::string s{"def"};
    letters.push_back(std::move(s));
 
    std::cout << "std::deque letters holds: ";
    for (auto&& e : letters)
        std::cout << std::quoted(e) << ' ';
 
    std::cout << "\nMoved-from string s holds: " << std::quoted(s) << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
std::deque letters holds: "abc" "def"
Moved-from string s holds: ""

```
