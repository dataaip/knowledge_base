| bool empty() const; |  | (noexcept since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Checks if the container has no elements, i.e. whether begin() == end().

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the container is empty, false otherwise.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

The following code uses `empty` to check if a std::deque<int> contains any elements:

Run this code

```
#include <deque>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::deque<int> numbers;
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << "Initially, numbers.empty(): " << numbers.empty() << '\n';
 
    numbers.push_back(42);
    numbers.push_back(13317); 
    std::cout << "After adding elements, numbers.empty(): " << numbers.empty() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Initially, numbers.empty(): true
After adding elements, numbers.empty(): false

```
