| Defined in header `<mdspan>` |  |  |
| template< class ElementType >  class default_accessor; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

A specialization of `std::default_accessor` class template is the default AccessorPolicy used by std::mdspan if no user-specified accessor policy is provided.

Each specialization of `default_accessor` models `semiregular` and is TriviallyCopyable.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ElementType | - | the element type. Shall be a complete object type that is neither an abstract class type nor an array type. Otherwise, the program is ill-formed |

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member type | Definition |
| `offset_policy` | `default_accessor` |
| `element_type` | `ElementType` |
| `reference` | `ElementType&` |
| `data_handle_type` | `ElementType*` |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a `default_accessor`   (public member function) |
| access | returns a nth element provided by arguments   (public member function) |
| offset | returns a data handle advanced by an offset value   (public member function) |

## std::default_accessor::default_accessor

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| constexpr default_accessor() noexcept = default; | (1) |  |
| template< class OtherElementType >  constexpr default_accessor( default_accessor<OtherElementType> ) noexcept {} | (2) |  |
|  |  |  |

1) Default constructs a `default_accessor`.2) Constructs a `default_accessor` from default_accessor<OtherElementType>. The constructor has no visible effect. This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_convertible_v<OtherElementType(\*)[], element_type(\*)[]> is true.

## std::default_accessor::access

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| constexpr reference access( data_handle_type p, std::size_t i ) const noexcept; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Equivalent to return p[i];.

## std::default_accessor::offset

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| constexpr data_handle_type offset( data_handle_type p, std::size_t i ) const noexcept; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Equivalent to return p + i;.
