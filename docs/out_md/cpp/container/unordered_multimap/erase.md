Removes specified elements from the container. The order of the remaining elements is preserved. (This makes it possible to erase individual elements while iterating through the container.)

1,2) Removes the element at pos.3) Removes the elements in the range ``first`,`last`)`, which must be a valid range in \*this.4) Removes all elements with the key equivalent to key.5) Removes all elements with key that compares **equivalent** to the value x. This overload participates in overload resolution only if Hash::is_transparent and KeyEqual::is_transparent are valid and each denotes a type, and neither `iterator` nor `const_iterator` is implicitly convertible from `K`. This assumes that such `Hash` is callable with both `K` and `Key` type, and that the `KeyEqual` is transparent, which, together, allows calling this function without constructing an instance of `Key`.

References and iterators to the erased elements are invalidated. Other iterators and references are not invalidated.

The iterator pos must be valid and dereferenceable. Thus the [end() iterator (which is valid, but is not dereferenceable) cannot be used as a value for pos.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | - | iterator to the element to remove |
| first, last | - | range of elements to remove |
| key | - | key value of the elements to remove |
| x | - | a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key denoting the elements to remove |

### Return value

1-3) Iterator following the last removed element.4) Number of elements removed.5) Number of elements removed.

### Exceptions

1-3) Throws nothing.4,5) Any exceptions thrown by the `Hash` and `KeyEqual` object.

### Complexity

Given an instance c of `unordered_multimap`:

1,2) Average case: constant, worst case: c.size().3) Average case: std::distance(first, last), worst case: c.size().4) Average case: c.count(key), worst case: c.size().5) Average case: c.count(x), worst case: c.size().

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_associative_heterogeneous_erasure` | `202110L` | (C++23) | Heterogeneous erasure in associative containers and unordered associative containers; overload (5) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::unordered_multimap<int, std::string> c =
    {
        {1, "one"}, {2, "two"}, {3, "three"},
        {4, "four"}, {5, "five"}, {6, "six"}
    };
 
    // erase all odd numbers from c
    for (auto it = c.begin(); it != c.end();)
    {
        if (it->first % 2 != 0)
            it = c.erase(it);
        else
            ++it;
    }
 
    for (auto& p : c)
        std::cout << p.second << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
two four six

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2059 | C++11 | there was ambiguity for overload (2) | added overload (1) |
| LWG 2356 | C++11 | the order of non-equivalent elements that are not erased was not guaranteed to be preserved | required to be preserved |
