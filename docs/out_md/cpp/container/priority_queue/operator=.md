Replaces the contents of the container adaptor with the contents of given argument.

1) Copy assignment operator. Replaces the contents with a copy of the contents of other. Effectively calls c = other.c; comp = other.comp;.2) Move assignment operator. Replaces the contents with those of other using move semantics. Effectively calls c = std::move(other.c); comp = std::move(other.comp);.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | another container adaptor to be used as source |

### Return value

\*this

### Complexity

1,2) Equivalent to that of operator= of the underlying
container.
