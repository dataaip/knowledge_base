Returns an iterator to the element following the last element of the `flat_map`.

This element acts as a placeholder; attempting to access it results in undefined behavior.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Iterator to the element following the last element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <flat_map>
 
int main()
{
    std::flat_map<int, double> map{{4, 4.13}, {9, 9.24}, {1, 1.09}};
 
    for (auto it = map.cbegin(); it != map.cend(); ++it)
        std::cout << '[' << it->first << "] = " << it->second << '\n';
 
    // Unlike std::map's bidirectional iterators, the std::flat_map iterators
    // are random-access, so they can be used with the operator[]:
    auto it = map.cbegin();
    assert(it[0] == map[1]);
    assert(it[1] == map[4]);
    assert(it[2] == map[9]);
}

```

Output:

```
[1] = 1.09
[4] = 4.13
[9] = 9.24

```
