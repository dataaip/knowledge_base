| void fill( const T& value ); |  | (since C++11)  (constexpr since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Assigns the value to all elements in the container.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | - | the value to assign to the elements |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Linear in the size of the container.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <array>
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr std::size_t xy = 4;
 
    using Cell = std::array<unsigned char, 8>;
 
    std::array<Cell, xy * xy> board;
 
    board.fill({0xE2, 0x96, 0x84, 0xE2, 0x96, 0x80, 0, 0}); // "▄▀";
 
    for (std::size_t count{}; Cell c : board)
        std::cout << c.data() << ((++count % xy) ? "" : "\n");
}

```

Possible output:

```
▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀
▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀
▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀
▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀

```
