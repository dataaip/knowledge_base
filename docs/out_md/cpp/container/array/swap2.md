| Defined in header `<array>` |  |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template< class T, std::size_t N >  void swap( std::array<T, N>& lhs, std::array<T, N>& rhs ); |  | (since C++11)  (until C++17) |
| template< class T, std::size_t N >  void swap( std::array<T, N>& lhs,             std::array<T, N>& rhs ) noexcept(/\* see below \*/); |  | (since C++17)  (constexpr since C++20) |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

Specializes the std::swap algorithm for std::array. Swaps the contents of lhs and rhs. Calls lhs.swap(rhs).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| This overload participates in overload resolution only if N == 0 or std::is_swappable_v<T> is true. | (since C++17) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | containers whose contents to swap |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Linear in size of the containers.

### Exceptions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| noexcept specification:noexcept(noexcept(lhs.swap(rhs))) | (since C++17) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
 
int main()
{
    std::array<int, 3> alice{1, 2, 3};
    std::array<int, 3> bob{7, 8, 9};
 
    auto print = [](const int& n) { std::cout << ' ' << n; };
 
    // Print state before swap
    std::cout << "Alice:";
    std::for_each(alice.begin(), alice.end(), print);
    std::cout << "\nBobby:";
    std::for_each(bob.begin(), bob.end(), print);
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    std::cout << "-- SWAP\n";
    std::swap(alice, bob);
 
    // Print state after swap
    std::cout << "Alice:";
    std::for_each(alice.begin(), alice.end(), print);
    std::cout << "\nBobby:";
    std::for_each(bob.begin(), bob.end(), print);
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Alice: 1 2 3
Bobby: 7 8 9
-- SWAP
Alice: 7 8 9
Bobby: 1 2 3

```
