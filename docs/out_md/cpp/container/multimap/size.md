| size_type size() const; |  | (noexcept since C++11) |

Returns the number of elements in the container, i.e. std::distance(begin(), end()).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The number of elements in the container.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <map>
 
int main()
{
    std::multimap<int, char> nums{{1, 'a'}, {1, 'b'}, {2, 'c'}, {2, 'd'}};
    assert(nums.size() == 4); 
}

```
