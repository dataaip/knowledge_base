| class value_compare; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

`std::multimap::value_compare` is a function object that compares objects of type `std::multimap::value_type` (key-value pairs) by comparing of the first components of the pairs.

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `result_type` (deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20) | bool |
| `first_argument_type` (deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20) | `value_type` |
| `second_argument_type` (deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20) | `value_type` |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| These member types are obtained via publicly inheriting std::binary_function<value_type, value_type, bool>. | (until C++11) |

### Protected member objects

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Compare comp | the stored comparator   (protected member object) |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ****(constructor)**** | constructs a new `value_compare` object   (protected member function) |
| ****operator()**** | compares two values of type `value_type`   (public member function) |

## std::multimap<Key,T,Compare,Alloc>::value_compare::value_compare

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| protected:  value_compare( Compare c ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Initializes the internal instance of the comparator to c.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c | - | comparator to assign |

## std::multimap<Key,T,Compare,Alloc>::value_compare::operator()

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bool operator()( const value_type& lhs, const value_type& rhs ) const; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Compares lhs.first and rhs.first by calling the stored comparator.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | values to compare |

### Return value

comp(lhs.first, rhs.first)

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
