| Defined in header `<cstdlib>` |  |  |
| int mbtowc( wchar_t\* pwc, const char\* s, std::size_t n ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Converts a multibyte character whose first byte is pointed to by s to a wide character, written to \*pwc if pwc is not null.

If s is a null pointer, resets the global conversion state and determines whether shift sequences are used.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| s | - | pointer to the multibyte character |
| n | - | limit on the number of bytes in s that can be examined |
| pwc | - | pointer to the wide character for output |

### Return value

If s is not a null pointer, returns the number of bytes that are contained in the multibyte character or -1 if the first bytes pointed to by s do not form a valid multibyte character or ​0​ if s is pointing at the null character '\0'.

If s is a null pointer, resets its internal conversion state to represent the initial shift state and returns ​0​ if the current multibyte encoding is not state-dependent (does not use shift sequences) or a non-zero value if the current multibyte encoding is state-dependent (uses shift sequences).

### Notes

Each call to `mbtowc` updates the internal global conversion state (a static object of type std::mbstate_t, only known to this function). If the multibyte encoding uses shift states, care must be taken to avoid backtracking or multiple scans. In any case, multiple threads should not call `mbtowc` without synchronization: std::mbrtowc may be used instead.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <clocale>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
 
int print_mb(const char* ptr)
{
    std::mbtowc(nullptr, 0, 0); // reset the conversion state
    const char* end = ptr + std::strlen(ptr);
    int ret{};
    for (wchar_t wc; (ret = std::mbtowc(&wc, ptr, end - ptr)) > 0; ptr += ret)
        std::wcout << wc;
    std::wcout << '\n';
    return ret;
}
 
int main()
{
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    // UTF-8 narrow multibyte encoding
    const char* str = "z\u00df\u6c34\U0001d10b"; // or "zß水𝄋"
                      // or "\x7a\xc3\x9f\xe6\xb0\xb4\xf0\x9d\x84\x8b";
    print_mb(str);
}

```

Output:

```
zß水𝄋

```
