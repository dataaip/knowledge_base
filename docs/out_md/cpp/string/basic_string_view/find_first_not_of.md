Finds the first character not equal to any of the characters in the given character sequence.

1) Finds the first character not equal to any of the characters of v in this view, starting at position pos.2) Equivalent to find_first_not_of(basic_string_view(std::addressof(ch), 1), pos).3) Equivalent to find_first_not_of(basic_string_view(s, count), pos).4) Equivalent to find_first_not_of(basic_string_view(s), pos).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v | - | view to search for |
| pos | - | position at which to start the search |
| count | - | length of the string of characters to compare |
| s | - | pointer to a string of characters to compare |
| ch | - | character to compare |

### Return value

Position of the first character not equal to any of the characters in the given string, or std::string_view::npos if no such character is found.

### Complexity

O(size() `* v.`size()) at worst.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <string_view>
using namespace std::literals;
 
int main()
{
    static_assert(2 == "BCDEF"sv.find_first_not_of("ABC"));
                    //    ^
    static_assert(4 == "BCDEF"sv.find_first_not_of("ABC", 4));
                    //      ^
    static_assert(1 == "BCDEF"sv.find_first_not_of('B'));
                    //   ^
    static_assert(3 == "BCDEF"sv.find_first_not_of('D', 2));
                    //     ^
}

```
