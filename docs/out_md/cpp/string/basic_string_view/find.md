| constexpr size_type find( CharT ch, size_type pos = 0 ) const noexcept; | (2) | (since C++17) |
| constexpr size_type find( const CharT\* s, size_type pos, size_type count ) const; | (3) | (since C++17) |
| constexpr size_type find( const CharT\* s, size_type pos = 0 ) const; | (4) | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Finds the first substring equal to the given character sequence.

1) Finds the first occurence of v in this view, starting at position pos.2) Equivalent to find(basic_string_view(std::addressof(ch), 1), pos).3) Equivalent to find(basic_string_view(s, count), pos).4) Equivalent to find(basic_string_view(s), pos).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v | - | view to search for |
| pos | - | position at which to start the search |
| count | - | length of substring to search for |
| s | - | pointer to a character string to search for |
| ch | - | character to search for |

### Return value

Position of the first character of the found substring, or npos if no such substring is found.

### Complexity

O(size() \* v.size()) at worst.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <string_view>
 
int main()
{
    using namespace std::literals;
 
    constexpr auto str{" long long int;"sv};
 
    static_assert(
        1 == str.find("long"sv)            && "<- find(v , pos = 0)" &&
        6 == str.find("long"sv, 2)         && "<- find(v , pos = 2)" &&
        0 == str.find(' ')                 && "<- find(ch, pos = 0)" &&
        2 == str.find('o', 1)              && "<- find(ch, pos = 1)" &&
        2 == str.find("on")                && "<- find(s , pos = 0)" &&
        6 == str.find("long double", 5, 4) && "<- find(s , pos = 5, count = 4)"
    );
 
    static_assert(str.npos == str.find("float"));
}

```
