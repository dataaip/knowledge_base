| --- | --- | --- |
| constexpr bool      ends_with( std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits> sv ) const noexcept; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| constexpr bool      ends_with( CharT ch ) const noexcept; | (2) | (since C++20) |
| constexpr bool      ends_with( const CharT\* s ) const; | (3) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Checks if the string ends with the given suffix. The suffix may be one of the following:

1) A string view sv (which may be a result of implicit conversion from another `std::basic_string`).2) A single character ch.3) A null-terminated character string s.

All three overloads effectively return std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>(data(), size()).ends_with(x), where `x` is the parameter.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sv | - | a string view which may be a result of implicit conversion from another `std::basic_string` |
| ch | - | a single character |
| s | - | a null-terminated character string |

### Return value

true if the string ends with the provided suffix, false otherwise.

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_starts_ends_with` | `201711L` | (C++20) | String prefix and suffix checking: starts_with() and ends_with() |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
 
int main()
{
    using namespace std::literals;
 
    const auto str = "Hello, C++20!"s;
 
    assert
    (""
        && str.ends_with("C++20!"sv)  // (1)
        && !str.ends_with("c++20!"sv) // (1)
        && str.ends_with("C++20!"s)   // (1) implicit conversion string to string_view
        && !str.ends_with("c++20!"s)  // (1) implicit conversion string to string_view
        && str.ends_with('!')         // (2)
        && !str.ends_with('?')        // (2)
        && str.ends_with("C++20!")    // (3)
        && !str.ends_with("c++20!")   // (3)
    );
}

```
