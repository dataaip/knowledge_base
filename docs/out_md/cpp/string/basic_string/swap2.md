|  |  |  |

Specializes the std::swap algorithm for std::basic_string. Swaps the contents of lhs and rhs.

Equivalent to lhs.swap(rhs).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | strings whose contents to swap |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Constant.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Exceptionsnoexcept specification:noexcept(noexcept(lhs.swap(rhs))) | (since C++17) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::string a = "AAA";
    std::string b = "BBBB";
 
    std::cout << "Before swap:\n"
                 "a = " << a << "\n"
                 "b = " << b << "\n\n";
 
    std::swap(a, b);
 
    std::cout << "After swap:\n"
                 "a = " << a << "\n"
                 "b = " << b << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Before swap:
a = AAA
b = BBBB
 
After swap:
a = BBBB
b = AAA

```

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2064 | C++11 | non-member `swap` was noexcept and inconsistent with member `swap` | noexcept removed |
