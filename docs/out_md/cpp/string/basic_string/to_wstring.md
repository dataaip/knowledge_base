Converts a numeric value to std::wstring.

| Let `buf` be an internal to the conversion functions buffer, sufficiently large to contain the result of conversion. 1) Converts a signed decimal integer to a wide string as if by std::swprintf(buf, sz, L"%d", value).2) Converts a signed decimal integer to a wide string as if by std::swprintf(buf, sz, L"%ld", value).3) Converts a signed decimal integer to a wide string as if by std::swprintf(buf, sz, L"%lld", value).4) Converts an unsigned decimal integer to a wide string as if by std::swprintf(buf, sz, L"%u", value).5) Converts an unsigned decimal integer to a wide string as if by std::swprintf(buf, sz, L"%lu", value).6) Converts an unsigned decimal integer to a wide string as if by std::swprintf(buf, sz, L"%llu", value).7,8) Converts a floating point value to a wide string as if by std::swprintf(buf, sz, L"%f", value).9) Converts a floating point value to a wide string as if by std::swprintf(buf, sz, L"%Lf", value). | (until C++26) |
| 1-9) Converts a numeric value to a wide string as if by std::format(L"{}", value). | (since C++26) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | - | a numeric value to convert |

### Return value

A wide string holding the converted value.

### Exceptions

May throw std::bad_alloc from the std::wstring constructor.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    for (const double f : {23.43, 1e-9, 1e40, 1e-40, 123456789.0})
        std::wcout << "std::wcout: " << f << '\n'
                   << "to_wstring: " << std::to_wstring(f) << "\n\n";
}

```

Output:

```
std::wcout: 23.43
to_wstring: 23.430000
 
std::wcout: 1e-09
to_wstring: 0.000000
 
std::wcout: 1e+40
to_wstring: 10000000000000000303786028427003666890752.000000
 
std::wcout: 1e-40
to_wstring: 0.000000
 
std::wcout: 1.23457e+08
to_wstring: 123456789.000000

```
