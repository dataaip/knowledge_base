Checks if the string has no characters, i.e. whether begin() == end().

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the string is empty, false otherwise

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::string s;
    std::boolalpha(std::cout);
    std::cout << "s.empty():" << s.empty() << "\t s:'" << s << "'\n";
 
    s = "Exemplar";
    std::cout << "s.empty():" << s.empty() << "\t s:'" << s << "'\n";
 
    s = "";
    std::cout << "s.empty():" << s.empty() << "\t s:'" << s << "'\n";
}

```

Output:

```
s.empty():true   s:''
s.empty():false  s:'Exemplar'
s.empty():true   s:''

```
