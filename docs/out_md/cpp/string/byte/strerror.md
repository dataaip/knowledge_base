| Defined in header `<cstring>` |  |  |
| char\* strerror( int errnum ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns a pointer to the textual description of the system error code errnum, identical to the description that would be printed by std::perror().

errnum is usually acquired from the `errno` variable, however the function accepts any value of type int. The contents of the string are locale-specific.

The returned string must not be modified by the program, but may be overwritten by a subsequent call to the `strerror` function. `strerror` is not required to be thread-safe. Implementations may be returning different pointers to static read-only string literals or may be returning the same pointer over and over, pointing at a static buffer in which `strerror` places the string.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| errnum | - | integer value referring to an error code |

### Return value

Pointer to a null-terminated byte string corresponding to the errno error code errnum.

### Notes

POSIX allows subsequent calls to `strerror` to invalidate the pointer value returned by an earlier call. It also specifies that it is the LC_MESSAGES locale facet that controls the contents of these messages.

POSIX has a thread-safe version called `strerror_r` defined. Glibc defines an incompatible version.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cerrno>
#include <clocale>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    const double not_a_number = std::log(-1.0);
    std::cout << not_a_number << '\n';
 
    if (errno == EDOM)
    {
        std::cout << "log(-1) failed: " << std::strerror(errno) << '\n';
        std::setlocale(LC_MESSAGES, "de_DE.utf8");
        std::cout << "Or, in German, " << std::strerror(errno) << '\n';
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
nan
log(-1) failed: Numerical argument out of domain
Or, in German, Das numerische Argument ist ausserhalb des Definitionsbereiches

```
