Interprets a floating point value in a byte string pointed to by str.

Function discards any whitespace characters (as determined by std::isspace) until first non-whitespace character is found. Then it takes as many characters as possible to form a valid floating-point representation and converts them to a floating-point value. The valid floating-point value can be one of the following:

- decimal floating-point expression. It consists of the following parts:

:   - (optional) plus or minus sign
    - nonempty sequence of decimal digits optionally containing decimal-point character (as determined by the current C locale) (defines significand)
    - (optional) `e` or `E` followed with optional minus or plus sign and nonempty sequence of decimal digits (defines exponent to base 10)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| - hexadecimal floating-point expression. It consists of the following parts:   - (optional) plus or minus sign - `0x` or `0X` - nonempty sequence of hexadecimal digits optionally containing a decimal-point character (as determined by the current C locale) (defines significand) - (optional) `p` or `P` followed with optional minus or plus sign and nonempty sequence of decimal digits (defines exponent to base 2)   - infinity expression. It consists of the following parts:   - (optional) plus or minus sign - `INF` or `INFINITY` ignoring case   - not-a-number expression. It consists of the following parts:   - (optional) plus or minus sign - `NAN` or `NAN(`**char_sequence**`)` ignoring case of the `NAN` part. **char_sequence** can only contain digits, Latin letters, and underscores. The result is a quiet NaN floating-point value. | (since C++11) |

- any other expression that may be accepted by the currently installed C locale

The functions sets the pointer pointed to by str_end to point to the character past the last character interpreted. If str_end is a null pointer, it is ignored.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| str | - | pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be interpreted |
| str_end | - | pointer to a pointer to character. |

### Return value

Floating point value corresponding to the contents of str on success. If the converted value falls out of range of corresponding return type, range error occurs and HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF or HUGE_VALL is returned. If no conversion can be performed, ​0​ is returned and \*str_end is set to str.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cerrno>
#include <clocale>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    const char* p = "111.11 -2.22 0X1.BC70A3D70A3D7P+6 -Inf 1.18973e+4932zzz";
    char* end{};
    std::cout << "Parsing \"" << p << "\":\n";
    errno = 0;
    for (double f = std::strtod(p, &end); p != end; f = std::strtod(p, &end))
    {
        std::cout << "  '" << std::string(p, end - p) << "' -> ";
        p = end;
        if (errno == ERANGE)
        {
            std::cout << "range error, got ";
            errno = 0;
        }
        std::cout << f << '\n';
    }
 
    if (std::setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "de_DE.utf8"))
    {
        std::cout << "With de_DE.utf8 locale:\n";
        std::cout << "  '123.45' -> " << std::strtod("123.45", 0) << '\n';
        std::cout << "  '123,45' -> " << std::strtod("123,45", 0) << '\n';
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
Parsing "111.11 -2.22 0X1.BC70A3D70A3D7P+6 -Inf 1.18973e+4932zzz":
  '111.11' -> 111.11
  ' -2.22' -> -2.22
  ' 0X1.BC70A3D70A3D7P+6' -> 111.11
  ' -Inf' -> -inf
  ' 1.18973e+4932' -> range error, got inf
With de_DE.utf8 locale:
  '123.45' -> 123
  '123,45' -> 123.45

```
