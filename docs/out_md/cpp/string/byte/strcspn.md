| Defined in header `<cstring>` |  |  |
| std::size_t strcspn( const char \*dest, const char \*src ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns the length of the maximum initial segment of the byte string pointed to by dest, that consists of only the characters **not** found in byte string pointed to by src.

The function name stands for "complementary span".

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dest | - | pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be analyzed |
| src | - | pointer to the null-terminated byte string that contains the characters to search for |

### Return value

The length of the maximum initial segment that contains only characters not found in the byte string pointed to by src.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstring>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::string s = "abcde312$#@";
    const char* invalid = "*$#";
 
    const std::size_t valid_len = std::strcspn(s.c_str(), invalid);
    if (valid_len != s.size())
    {
        std::cout << std::quoted(s)
                  << " contains invalid chars starting at position "
                  << valid_len << '\n'
                  << std::string(valid_len + 1, '-') << "^\n";
    }
}

```

Output:

```
"abcde312$#@" contains invalid chars starting at position 8
---------^

```
