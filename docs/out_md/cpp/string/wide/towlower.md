|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<cwctype>` |  |  |
| std::wint_t towlower( std::wint_t ch ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Converts the given wide character to lowercase, if possible.

If the value of ch is neither representable as a wchar_t nor equal to the value of the macro WEOF, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ch | - | wide character to be converted |

### Return value

Lowercase version of ch or unmodified ch if no lowercase version is listed in the current C locale.

### Notes

Only 1:1 character mapping can be performed by this function, e.g. the Greek uppercase letter 'Σ' has two lowercase forms, depending on the position in a word: 'σ' and 'ς'. A call to `std::towlower` cannot be used to obtain the correct lowercase form in this case.

ISO 30112 specifies which pairs of Unicode characters are included in this mapping.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <clocale>
#include <cwctype>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    wchar_t c = L'\u0190'; // Latin capital open E ('Ɛ')
 
    std::cout << std::hex << std::showbase;
    std::cout << "in the default locale, towlower("
              << static_cast<std::wint_t>(c) << ") = "
              << std::towlower(c) << '\n';
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    std::cout << "in Unicode locale, towlower("
              << static_cast<std::wint_t>(c) << ") = "
              << std::towlower(c) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
in the default locale, towlower(0x190) = 0x190
in Unicode locale, towlower(0x190) = 0x25b

```
