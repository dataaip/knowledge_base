| Defined in header `<cwchar>` |  |  |
| const wchar_t\* wcsstr( const wchar_t\* dest, const wchar_t\* src ); |  |  |
| wchar_t\* wcsstr(       wchar_t\* dest, const wchar_t\* src ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Finds the first occurrence of the wide string src in the wide string pointed to by dest. The terminating null characters are not compared.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dest | - | pointer to the null-terminated wide string to examine |
| src | - | pointer to the null-terminated wide string to search for |

### Return value

Pointer to the first character of the found substring in dest, or a null pointer if no such substring is found. If src points to an empty string, dest is returned.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <clocale>
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    wchar_t const* origin = L"アルファ, ベータ, ガンマ, アルファ, ベータ, ガンマ.";
    wchar_t const* target = L"ベータ";
    wchar_t const* result = origin;
 
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    std::wcout << L"Substring to find: \"" << target << L"\"\n"
               << L"String to search: \"" << origin << L"\"\n\n";
 
    for (; (result = std::wcsstr(result, target)) != nullptr; ++result)
        std::wcout << L"Found: \"" << result << L"\"\n";
}

```

Possible output:

```
Substring to find: "ベータ"
String to search: "アルファ, ベータ, ガンマ, アルファ, ベータ, ガンマ."
 
Found: "ベータ, ガンマ, アルファ, ベータ, ガンマ."
Found: "ベータ, ガンマ."

```
