| Defined in header `<cwchar>` |  |  |
| const wchar_t\* wmemchr( const wchar_t\* ptr, wchar_t ch, std::size_t count ); | (1) |  |
| wchar_t\* wmemchr(       wchar_t\* ptr, wchar_t ch, std::size_t count ); | (2) |  |
|  |  |  |

Locates the first occurrence of wide character ch in the initial count wide characters of the wide character array pointed to by ptr.

If count is zero, the function returns a null pointer.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ptr | - | pointer to the wide character array to be examined |
| ch | - | wide character to search for |
| count | - | number of wide characters to examine |

### Return value

Pointer to the location of the wide character, or a null pointer if no such character is found.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <clocale>
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
    const wchar_t str[] = L"诺不轻信，故人不负我\0诺不轻许，故我不负人。";
    wchar_t target = L'许';
    const std::size_t sz = sizeof str / sizeof *str;
    if (const wchar_t* result = std::wmemchr(str, target, sz))
    {
        std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
        std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
        std::wcout << "Found '" << target << "' at position " << result - str << '\n';
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
Found '许' at position 14

```
