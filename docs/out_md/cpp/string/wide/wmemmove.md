| Defined in header `<cwchar>` |  |  |
| wchar_t\* wmemmove( wchar_t\* dest, const wchar_t\* src, std::size_t count ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Copies exactly count successive wide characters from the wide character array pointed to by src to the wide character array pointed to by dest.

If count is zero, the function does nothing.

The arrays may overlap: copying takes place as if the wide characters were copied to a temporary wide character array and then copied from the temporary array to dest.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dest | - | pointer to the wide character array to copy to |
| src | - | pointer to the wide character array to copy from |
| count | - | number of wide characters to copy |

### Return value

Returns a copy of dest.

### Notes

This function is not locale-sensitive and pays no attention to the values of the wchar_t objects it copies: nulls as well as invalid characters are copied too.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <clocale>
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
 
    wchar_t str[] = L"αβγδεζηθικλμνξοπρστυφχψω";
    std::wcout << str << '\n';
    std::wmemmove(str + 4, str + 3, 3); // copy from [δεζ] to [εζη]
    std::wcout << str << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
αβγδεζηθικλμνξοπρστυφχψω
αβγδδεζθικλμνξοπρστυφχψω

```
