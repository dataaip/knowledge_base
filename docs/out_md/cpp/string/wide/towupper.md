|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<cwctype>` |  |  |
| std::wint_t towupper( std::wint_t ch ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Converts the given wide character to uppercase, if possible.

If the value of ch is neither representable as a wchar_t nor equal to the value of the macro WEOF, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ch | - | wide character to be converted |

### Return value

Uppercase version of ch or unmodified ch if no uppercase version is listed in the current C locale.

### Notes

Only 1:1 character mapping can be performed by this function, e.g. the uppercase form of 'ß' is (with some exceptions) the two-character string "SS", which cannot be obtained by `std::towupper`.

ISO 30112 specifies which pairs of Unicode characters are included in this mapping.

### Example

The latin letter 'ſ' (U+017F) is the alternative lowercase form of 'S' (U+0053).

Run this code

```
#include <clocale>
#include <cwctype>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    wchar_t c = L'\u017f'; // Latin small letter Long S ('ſ')
 
    std::cout << std::hex << std::showbase;
    std::cout << "in the default locale, towupper("
              << static_cast<std::wint_t>(c) << ") = "
              << std::towupper(c) << '\n';
 
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    std::cout << "in Unicode locale, towupper("
              << static_cast<std::wint_t>(c) << ") = "
              << std::towupper(c) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
in the default locale, towupper(0x17f) = 0x17f
in Unicode locale, towupper(0x17f) = 0x53

```
