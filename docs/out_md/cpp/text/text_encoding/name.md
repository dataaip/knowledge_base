| constexpr const char\* name() const noexcept; |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the primary name of \*this. Equivalent to return`name_`;.

Accessing elements of `name_` outside of the range ``name()`,`name() + [std::strlen(name()) + 1`)` is undefined behavior.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Primary name `name_` that is represented by a null-terminated byte string.
