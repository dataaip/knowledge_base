Produces random numbers according to the Generalized extreme value distribution (it is also known as Gumbel Type I, log-Weibull, Fisher-Tippett Type I):

:   \({\small p(x;a,b) = \frac{1}{b} \exp{(\frac{a-x}{b}-\exp{(\frac{a-x}{b})})} }\)p(x;a,b) =

`std::extreme_value_distribution` satisfies all requirements of RandomNumberDistribution.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RealType | - | The result type generated by the generator. The effect is undefined if this is not one of float, double, or long double. |

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member type | Definition |
| `result_type` (C++11) | RealType |
| `param_type` (C++11) | the type of the parameter set, see RandomNumberDistribution. |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor)(C++11) | constructs new distribution   (public member function) |
| reset(C++11) | resets the internal state of the distribution   (public member function) |
| Generation | |
| operator()")(C++11) | generates the next random number in the distribution   (public member function) |
| Characteristics | |
| ab(C++11) | returns the distribution parameters   (public member function) |
| param(C++11) | gets or sets the distribution parameter object   (public member function) |
| min(C++11) | returns the minimum potentially generated value   (public member function) |
| max(C++11) | returns the maximum potentially generated value   (public member function) |

### Non-member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator==operator!=(C++11)(C++11)(removed in C++20) | compares two distribution objects   (function) |
| operator<<operator>>(C++11) | performs stream input and output on pseudo-random number distribution   (function template) |

}
 
int main()
{
    std::random_device rd{};
    std::mt19937 gen{rd()};
 
    std::extreme_value_distribution<> d{-1.618f, 1.618f};
 
    const int norm = 10'000;
    const float cutoff = 0.000'3f;
 
    std::map<int, int> hist{};
    for (int n = 0; n != norm; ++n)
        ++hist[std::round(d(gen))];
 
    std::vector<float> bars;
    std::vector<int> indices;
    for (const auto& [n, p] : hist)
        if (const float x = p * (1.0f / norm); x > cutoff)
        {
            bars.push_back(x);
            indices.push_back(n);
