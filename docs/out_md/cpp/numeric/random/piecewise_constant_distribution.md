`std::piecewise_constant_distribution` produces random floating-point numbers, which are uniformly distributed within each of the several subintervals bi, bi+1), each with its own weight wi. The set of interval boundaries and the set of weights are the parameters of this distribution.

The probability density for any bi ≤ x <bi+1 is 

|  |
| --- |
| wi |
| S (bi+1 - bi) |

, where S is the sum of all weights.

[`std::piecewise_constant_distribution` satisfies all requirements of RandomNumberDistribution.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RealType | - | The result type generated by the generator. The effect is undefined if this is not one of float, double, or long double. |

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member type | Definition |
| `result_type` (C++11) | RealType |
| `param_type` (C++11) | the type of the parameter set, see RandomNumberDistribution. |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor)(C++11) | constructs new distribution   (public member function) |
| reset(C++11) | resets the internal state of the distribution   (public member function) |
| Generation | |
| operator()")(C++11) | generates the next random number in the distribution   (public member function) |
| Characteristics | |
| intervalsdensities | returns the distribution parameters   (public member function) |
| param(C++11) | gets or sets the distribution parameter object   (public member function) |
| min(C++11) | returns the minimum potentially generated value   (public member function) |
| max(C++11) | returns the maximum potentially generated value   (public member function) |

### Non-member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator==operator!=(C++11)(C++11)(removed in C++20) | compares two distribution objects   (function) |
| operator<<operator>>(C++11) | performs stream input and output on pseudo-random number distribution   (function template) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <random>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 gen(rd());
    // 50% of the time, generate a random number between 0 and 1
    // 50% of the time, generate a random number between 10 and 15
    std::vector<double> i {0, 1, 10, 15};
    std::vector<double> w {1, 0, 1};
    std::piecewise_constant_distribution<> d(i.begin(), i.end(), w.begin());
 
    std::map<int, int> hist;
    for (int n {}; n < 1e4; ++n)
        ++hist[d(gen)];
 
    for (std::cout << std::hex << std::uppercase; auto [x, y] : hist)
        std::cout << x << ' ' << std::string(y / 100, '*') << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
