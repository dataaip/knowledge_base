1-3) Computes the natural (base **e**) logarithm of num. The library provides overloads of `std::log` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter.(since C++23)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| S) The SIMD overload performs an element-wise `std::log` on v_num. (See **math-floating-point** and **deduced-simd-t** for their definitions.) | (since C++26) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double. | (since C++11) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| num | - | floating-point or integer value |

### Return value

If no errors occur, the natural (base-**e**) logarithm of num (ln(num) or loge(num)) is returned.

If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where supported).

If a pole error occurs, -HUGE_VAL, `-HUGE_VALF`, or `-HUGE_VALL` is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

Domain error occurs if num is less than zero.

Pole error may occur if num is zero.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If the argument is ±0, -∞ is returned and FE_DIVBYZERO is raised.
- If the argument is 1, +0 is returned.
- If the argument is negative, NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised.
- If the argument is +∞, +∞ is returned.
- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::log(num) has the same effect as std::log(static_cast<double>(num)).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cerrno>
#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "log(1) = " << std::log(1) << '\n'
              << "base-5 logarithm of 125 = " << std::log(125) / std::log(5) << '\n';
 
    // special values
    std::cout << "log(1) = " << std::log(1) << '\n'
              << "log(+Inf) = " << std::log(INFINITY) << '\n';
 
    // error handling
    errno = 0;
    std::feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
 
    std::cout << "log(0) = " << std::log(0) << '\n';
 
    if (errno == ERANGE)
        std::cout << "    errno == ERANGE: " << std::strerror(errno) << '\n';
    if (std::fetestexcept(FE_DIVBYZERO))
        std::cout << "    FE_DIVBYZERO raised\n";
}

```

Possible output:

```
log(1) = 0
base-5 logarithm of 125 = 3
log(1) = 0
log(+Inf) = inf
log(0) = -inf
    errno == ERANGE: Numerical result out of range
    FE_DIVBYZERO raised

```
