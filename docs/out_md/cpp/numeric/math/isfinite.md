| Additional overloads |  |  |
| Defined in header `<cmath>` |  |  |
| template< class Integer >  bool isfinite( Integer num ); | (A) | (since C++11)  (constexpr since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

1) Determines if the given floating point number num has finite value i.e. it is normal, subnormal or zero, but not infinite or NaN. The library provides overloads for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter num.(since C++23)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| S) The SIMD overload performs an element-wise `std::isfinite` on v_num. (See **math-floating-point** and **deduced-simd-t** for their definitions.) | (since C++26) |

A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| num | - | floating-point or integer value |
| v_num | - | a data-parallel object of std::basic_simd specialization where its element type is a floating-point type |

### Return value

1) true if num has finite value, false otherwise.S) A data-parallel mask object where the ith element equals true if v_num[i] has finite value or false otherwise for all i in the range ``​0​`,`v_num.size()`)`.

### Notes

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::isfinite(num) has the same effect as std::isfinite(static_cast<double>(num)).

### Examples

Run this code

```
#include <cfloat>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << std::boolalpha
              << "isfinite(NaN) = " << std::isfinite(NAN) << '\n'
              << "isfinite(Inf) = " << std::isfinite(INFINITY) << '\n'
              << "isfinite(-Inf) = " << std::isfinite(-INFINITY) << '\n'
              << "isfinite(HUGE_VAL) = " << std::isfinite(HUGE_VAL) << '\n'
              << "isfinite(0.0) = " << std::isfinite(0.0) << '\n'
              << "isfinite(exp(800)) = " << std::isfinite(std::exp(800)) << '\n'
              << "isfinite(DBL_MIN/2.0) = " << std::isfinite(DBL_MIN / 2.0) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
isfinite(NaN) = false
isfinite(Inf) = false
isfinite(-Inf) = false
isfinite(HUGE_VAL) = false
isfinite(0.0) = true
isfinite(exp(800)) = false
isfinite(DBL_MIN/2.0) = true

```
