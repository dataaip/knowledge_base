Implements the analogs of the unary arithmetic operators for complex numbers.

1) Returns the value of its argument2) Negates the argument

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| val | - | the complex number argument |

### Return value

1) a copy of the argument, std::complex<T>(val)2) negated argument, std::complex<T>(-val.real(), -val.imag())
