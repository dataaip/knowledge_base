| valarray<T> cshift( int count ) const; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns a new valarray of the same size with elements whose positions are shifted circularly by count elements.

A non-negative value of count shifts the elements circularly left count places and a negative value of count shifts the elements circularly right -count places.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| count | - | number of positions to shift the elements by |

### Return value

The resulting valarray with circularly shifted elements.

### Notes

The function can be implemented with the return type different from std::valarray. In this case, the replacement type has the following properties:

:   - All const member functions of std::valarray are provided.
    - std::valarray, std::slice_array, std::gslice_array, std::mask_array and std::indirect_array can be constructed from the replacement type.
    - For every function taking a const std::valarray<T>& except begin() and end()(since C++11), identical functions taking the replacement types shall be added;
    - For every function taking two const std::valarray<T>& arguments, identical functions taking every combination of const std::valarray<T>& and replacement types shall be added.
    - The return type does not add more than two levels of template nesting over the most deeply-nested argument type.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <valarray>
 
int main()
{
    std::valarray<int> v{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
 
    for (auto const& val : v)
        std::cout << val << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    std::valarray<int> v2 = v.cshift(2);
 
    for (auto const& val : v2)
        std::cout << val << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 618 | C++98 | the expression of the shifted elements contains zero-division if `size()` is ​0​ | describes the new positions without using expressions |
