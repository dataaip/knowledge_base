| Defined in header `<valarray>` |  |  |
| template< class T >  valarray<T> acos( const valarray<T>& va ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

For each element in va computes arc cosine of the value of the element.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| va | - | value array to apply the operation to |

### Return value

Value array containing arc cosines of the values in va.

### Notes

Unqualified function (acos) is used to perform the computation. If such function is not available, std::acos is used due to argument-dependent lookup.

The function can be implemented with the return type different from std::valarray. In this case, the replacement type has the following properties:

:   - All const member functions of std::valarray are provided.
    - std::valarray, std::slice_array, std::gslice_array, std::mask_array and std::indirect_array can be constructed from the replacement type.
    - For every function taking a const std::valarray<T>& except begin() and end()(since C++11), identical functions taking the replacement types shall be added;
    - For every function taking two const std::valarray<T>& arguments, identical functions taking every combination of const std::valarray<T>& and replacement types shall be added.
    - The return type does not add more than two levels of template nesting over the most deeply-nested argument type.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class T> valarray<T> acos(const valarray<T>& va) {     valarray<T> other = va;     for (T& i : other)         i = acos(i);       return other; // proxy object may be returned } ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <numbers>
#include <valarray>
 
int main()
{
    // take common x-values from unit circle
    const double s32 = std::sqrt(3.0) / 2.0;
    const double s22 = std::sqrt(2.0) / 2.0;
    std::valarray<double> v1 = {-1.0, -s32, -s22, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, s22, s32, 1.0};
    std::valarray<double> v2 = std::acos(v1) * 180.0 / std::numbers::pi;
 
    for (double n : v2)
        std::cout << n << "° ";
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
180° 150° 135° 120° 90° 60° 45° 30° 0°

```
