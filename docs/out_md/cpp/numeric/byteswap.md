| template< class T >  constexpr T byteswap( T n ) noexcept; |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Reverses the bytes in the given integer value n.

`std::byteswap` participates in overload resolution only if `T` satisfies `integral`, i.e., `T` is an integer type. The program is ill-formed if `T` has padding bits.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | - | integer value |

### Return value

An integer value of type `T` whose object representation comprises the bytes of that of n in reversed order.

### Notes

This function is useful for processing data of different endianness.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_byteswap` | `202110L` | (C++23) | `std::byteswap` |

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<std::integral T> constexpr T byteswap(T value) noexcept {     static_assert(std::has_unique_object_representations_v<T>,                    "T may not have padding bits");     auto value_representation = std::bit_cast<std::array<std::byte, sizeof(T)>>(value);     std::ranges::reverse(value_representation);     return std::bit_cast<T>(value_representation); } ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <bit>
#include <concepts>
#include <cstdint>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
template<std::integral T>
void dump(T v, char term = '\n')
{
    std::cout << std::hex << std::uppercase << std::setfill('0')
              << std::setw(sizeof(T) * 2) << v << " : ";
    for (std::size_t i{}; i != sizeof(T); ++i, v >>= 8)
        std::cout << std::setw(2) << static_cast<unsigned>(T(0xFF) & v) << ' ';
    std::cout << std::dec << term;
}
 
int main()
{
    static_assert(std::byteswap('a') == 'a');
 
    std::cout << "byteswap for U16:\n";
    constexpr auto x = std::uint16_t(0xCAFE);
    dump(x);
    dump(std::byteswap(x));
 
    std::cout << "\nbyteswap for U32:\n";
    constexpr auto y = std::uint32_t(0xDEADBEEFu);
    dump(y);
    dump(std::byteswap(y));
 
    std::cout << "\nbyteswap for U64:\n";
    constexpr auto z = std::uint64_t{0x0123456789ABCDEFull};
    dump(z);
    dump(std::byteswap(z));
}

```

Possible output:

```
byteswap for U16:
CAFE : FE CA
FECA : CA FE
 
byteswap for U32:
DEADBEEF : EF BE AD DE
EFBEADDE : DE AD BE EF
 
byteswap for U64:
0123456789ABCDEF : EF CD AB 89 67 45 23 01
EFCDAB8967452301 : 01 23 45 67 89 AB CD EF

```
