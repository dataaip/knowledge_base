| void lock(); |  | (since C++14) |
|  |  |  |

Locks the mutex. If another thread has already locked the mutex, a call to `lock` will block execution until the lock is acquired.

If `lock` is called by a thread that already owns the `mutex` in any mode (shared or exclusive), the behavior is undefined.

Prior unlock() operations on the same mutex **synchronize-with** (as defined in std::memory_order) this operation.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

Throws std::system_error when errors occur, including errors from the underlying operating system that would prevent `lock` from meeting its specifications. The mutex is not locked in the case of any exception being thrown.

### Notes

`lock()` is usually not called directly: std::unique_lock, std::scoped_lock, and std::lock_guard are used to manage exclusive locking.

Shared mutexes do not support direct transition from shared to unique ownership mode: the shared lock has to be relinquished with unlock_shared() before exclusive ownership may be obtained with `lock()`. boost::upgrade_mutex may be used for this purpose.

### Example

This example shows how `lock` and `unlock` can be used to protect shared data.

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
 
int g_num = 0; // protected by g_num_mutex
std::mutex g_num_mutex;
 
void slow_increment(int id) 
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)
    {
        g_num_mutex.lock(); 
        ++g_num;
        // note, that the mutex also syncronizes the output
        std::cout << "id: " << id << ", g_num: " << g_num << '\n';
        g_num_mutex.unlock();
 
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(234));
    }
}
 
int main()
{
    std::thread t1{slow_increment, 0};
    std::thread t2{slow_increment, 1};
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
}

```

Possible output:

```
id: 0, g_num: 1
id: 1, g_num: 2
id: 1, g_num: 3
id: 0, g_num: 4
id: 0, g_num: 5
id: 1, g_num: 6

```
