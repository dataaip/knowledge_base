1) Minimum offset between two objects to avoid false sharing. Guaranteed to be at least alignof(std::max_align_t)

```
struct keep_apart
{
    alignas(std::hardware_destructive_interference_size) std::atomic<int> cat;
    alignas(std::hardware_destructive_interference_size) std::atomic<int> dog;
};

```

2) Maximum size of contiguous memory to promote true sharing. Guaranteed to be at least alignof(std::max_align_t)

```
struct together
{
    std::atomic<int> dog;
    int puppy;
};
 
struct kennel
{
    // Other data members...
 
    alignas(sizeof(together)) together pack;
 
    // Other data members...
};
 
static_assert(sizeof(together) <= std::hardware_constructive_interference_size);

```

### Notes

These constants provide a portable way to access the L1 data cache line size.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_hardware_interference_size` | `201703L` | (C++17) | constexpr std::hardware_constructive_interference_size and  constexpr std::hardware_destructive_interference_size |

### Example

The program uses two threads that atomically write to the data members of the given global objects. The first object fits in one cache line, which results in "hardware interference". The second object keeps its data members on separate cache lines, so possible "cache synchronization" after thread writes is avoided.
