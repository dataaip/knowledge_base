| pos_type tellp(); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns the output position indicator of the current associated `streambuf` object.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Behaves as UnformattedOutputFunction (except without actually performing output). After constructing and checking the sentry object, | (since C++11) |

If fail()==true, returns pos_type(-1). Otherwise, returns rdbuf()->pubseekoff(0, std::ios_base::cur, std::ios_base::out).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

current output position indicator on success, pos_type(-1) if a failure occurs.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
int main()
{
    std::ostringstream s;
    std::cout << s.tellp() << '\n';
    s << 'h';
    std::cout << s.tellp() << '\n';
    s << "ello, world ";
    std::cout << s.tellp() << '\n';
    s << 3.14 << '\n';
    std::cout << s.tellp() << '\n' << s.str();
}

```

Output:

```
0
1
13
18
hello, world 3.14

```
