| protected:  virtual void imbue( const std::locale& loc ) |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Changes the associated locale so that all characters inserted or extracted after this call (and until another call to `imbue()`) are converted using the std::codecvt facet of `loc`.

If the old locale's encoding is state-dependent and file is not positioned at the beginning, then the new locale must have the same std::codecvt facet as the one previously imbued.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| loc | - | the locale to imbue the stream with |

### Return value

(none)

| imbue[virtual] | reacts to a change of the associated locale   (virtual protected member function of `std::basic_streambuf<CharT,Traits>`) |
| imbue | sets the locale   (public member function of `std::basic_ios<CharT,Traits>`) |
