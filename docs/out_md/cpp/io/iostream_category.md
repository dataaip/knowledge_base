| Defined in header `<ios>` |  |  |
| const std::error_category& iostream_category() noexcept; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Obtains a reference to the static error category object for iostream errors. The object is required to override the virtual function error_category::name() to return a pointer to the string "iostream". It is used to identify error codes provided in the exceptions of type std::ios_base::failure.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A reference to the static object of unspecified runtime type, derived from std::error_category.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::ifstream f("doesn't exist");
    try
    {
        f.exceptions(f.failbit);
    }
    catch (const std::ios_base::failure& e)
    {
        std::cout << "Caught an ios_base::failure.\n"
                  << "Error code: " << e.code().value() 
                  << " (" << e.code().message() << ")\n"
                  << "Error category: " << e.code().category().name() << '\n';
 
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
Caught an ios_base::failure.
Error code: 1 (unspecified iostream_category error)
Error category: iostream

```
