| void setstate( iostate state ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Sets the stream error flags state in addition to currently set flags. Essentially calls clear(rdstate() | state). May throw an exception.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| state | - | stream error state flags to set. It can be a combination of the following constants:  |  |  | | --- | --- | | Constant | Explanation | | goodbit | no error | | badbit | irrecoverable stream error | | failbit | input/output operation failed (formatting or extraction error) | | eofbit | associated input sequence has reached end-of-file | |

### Return value

(none)

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
    std::ostringstream stream;
 
    if (!stream.fail())
        std::cout << "stream is not fail\n";
 
    stream.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit);
 
    if (stream.fail())
        std::cout << "now stream is fail\n";
 
    if (!stream.good())
        std::cout << "and stream is not good\n";
}

```

Output:

```
stream is not fail
now stream is fail
and stream is not good

```
