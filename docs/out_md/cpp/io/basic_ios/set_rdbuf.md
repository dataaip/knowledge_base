| protected:  void set_rdbuf( std::basic_streambuf<CharT,Traits>\* sb ); |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Sets the associated stream buffer to `sb` without clearing the error state.

This member function is protected: it is called by the move constructors of the derived streams such as std::basic_ofstream or std::basic_istringstream, as the final step after constructing the base class and after moving the stream buffer: only the most derived stream class knows how to correctly move the stream buffer, but std::basic_ios needs to be made aware of the stream's new location so that its public member functions can access it.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sb | - | stream buffer to associate to |

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions
