| char narrow( char_type c, char dfault ) const; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Converts a current locale-specific character c to its standard equivalent. The result is converted from `char_type` to char if needed. If no conversion can be performed, the function returns dfault.

Effectively calls std::use_facet< std::ctype<char_type> >(getloc()).narrow(c, dfault);.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c | - | character to convert |
| dfault | - | character to return if the conversion was unsuccessful |

### Return value

Character converted to its standard equivalent and then to char. dfault is returned if the conversion fails.
