| basic_spanbuf& operator=( basic_spanbuf&& rhs ); | (1) | (since C++23) |
| basic_spanbuf& operator( const basic_spanbuf& ) = delete; | (2) | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

1) Move assignment operator. Equivalent to auto tmp{std::move(rhs)}; this->swap(tmp); return \*this;. After move assignment, \*this holds the state rhs held before move assignment. It is implementation-defined whether rhs still hold the underlying buffer after move assignment.2) The copy assignment operator is deleted; `basic_spanbuf` is not CopyAssignable.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rhs | - | another `basic_spanbuf` that will be moved from |

### Return value

\*this

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
