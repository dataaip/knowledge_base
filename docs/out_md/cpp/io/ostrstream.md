| Defined in header `<strstream>` |  |  |
| class ostrstream : public std::ostream |  | (deprecated in C++98)  (removed in C++26) |
|  |  |  |

The class `ostrstream` implements output operations on array-backed streams. It essentially wraps a raw array I/O device implementation (std::strstreambuf) into the higher-level interface of std::basic_ostream.

The typical implementation of `ostrstream` holds only one non-derived data member: an object of type std::strstreambuf.

### Notes

After any call to str(), a call to freeze(false) is required to allow the destructor to deallocate the buffer as necessary.

Before any call to str() that uses the result as a C-string, the buffer must be null-terminated, typically with std::ends.

`ostrstream` has been deprecated since C++98 and removed since C++26. std::ostringstream, std::ospanstream(since C++23), and `boost::iostreams::array_sink` are the recommended replacements.
