| std::locale getloc() const; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns the current locale associated with the stream.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The locale object associated with the stream.

### Example

The output shown was obtained using the clang compiler.

Run this code

```
#include <codecvt>
#include <ctime>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::wbuffer_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>> conv(std::cout.rdbuf());
    std::wostream out(&conv);
 
    out.imbue(std::locale(out.getloc(),
                          new std::time_put_byname<wchar_t>("ja_JP.utf8")));
 
    std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);
    out << std::put_time(std::localtime(&t), L"%A %c") << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
