| streamsize precision() const; | (1) |  |

|  |  |  |

Manages the precision (i.e. how many digits are generated) of floating point output performed by std::num_put::do_put.

1) Returns the current precision.2) Sets the precision to the given one. Returns the previous precision.

The default precision, as established by std::basic_ios::init, is 6.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| new_precision | - | new precision setting |

### Return value

The precision before the call to the function

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    const double d = 12.345678901234;
    std::cout << "The  default precision is " << std::cout.precision() << "\n\n";
    std::cout << "With default precision d is " << d << '\n';
    std::cout.precision(8);
    std::cout << "With high    precision d is " << d << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
The  default precision is 6
 
With default precision d is 12.3457
With high    precision d is 12.345679

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 189 | C++98 | 'precision' was defined as 'the number of digits after the decimal point', but it is not correct in some cases | corrected |
