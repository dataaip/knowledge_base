| typedef void ( \*event_callback )( event type, ios_base& ios, int index ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

The type of function callbacks that can be registered using register_callback() to be called on specific events.

type is a value of type ios_base::event which indicates the type of the event that will invoke this callback.

ios refers to the stream object for which the callback is invoked: \*this is passed as the argument when callbacks are invoked by std::ios_base and std::basic_ios member functions.

index is the user-provided value passed to register_callback() when registering the function.
