| Defined in header `<cstdio>` |  |  |
| void perror( const char \*s ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Prints a textual description of the error code currently stored in the system variable errno to stderr.

The description is formed by concatenating the following components:

- the contents of the null-terminated byte string pointed to by s, followed by ": " (unless s is a null pointer or the character pointed to by s is the null character).
- implementation-defined error message string describing the error code stored in `errno`, followed by '\n'. The error message string is identical to the result of std::strerror(errno).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| s | - | pointer to a null-terminated string with explanatory message |

### Return value

(none)

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cerrno>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
 
int main()
{
    double not_a_number = std::log(-1.0);
    if (errno == EDOM)
        std::perror("log(-1) failed");
    std::printf("%f\n", not_a_number);
}

```

Possible output:

```
log(-1) failed: Numerical argument out of domain
nan

```
