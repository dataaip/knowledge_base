| std::ios_base& unitbuf( std::ios_base& str ); | (1) |  |
| std::ios_base& nounitbuf( std::ios_base& str ); | (2) |  |
|  |  |  |

Enables or disables automatic flushing of the output stream after any output operation. Has no effect on input.

1) Enables the `unitbuf` flag in the stream str as if by calling str.setf(std::ios_base::unitbuf).2) Disables the `unitbuf` flag in the stream str as if by calling str.unsetf(std::ios_base::unitbuf).

This is an I/O manipulator, it may be called with an expression such as out << std::unitbuf for any `out` of type std::basic_ostream or with an expression such as in >> std::unitbuf for any `in` of type std::basic_istream.

### Notes

Flushing is performed in the destructor of the std::basic_ostream::sentry object, which calls str.rdbuf()->pubsync() if str.flags() & std::ios_base::unitbuf is true.

The standard output objects std::cerr and std::wcerr have their `unitbuf` bit set by default.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| str | - | reference to I/O stream |

### Return value

str (reference to the stream after manipulation).

### Example

Without `std::unitbuf` or another explicit flush, the output is the same, but does not appear in real time.

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
 
template<typename Diff>
void log_progress(Diff d)
{
    std::cout << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(d)
              << " ... ";
}
 
int main()
{
    volatile int sink = 0;
    std::cout << std::unitbuf; // enable automatic flushing
 
    const auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    for (int j = 0; j < 5; ++j)
    {
        for (int n = 0; n < 10000; ++n)
            for (int m = 0; m < 20000; ++m)
                sink += m * n; // do some work
        log_progress(std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() - start);
    }
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
571ms ... 1146ms ... 1722ms ... 2294ms ... 2865ms ...

```
