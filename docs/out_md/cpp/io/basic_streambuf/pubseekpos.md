Sets the position indicator of the input and/or output sequence to an absolute position.

1) Calls seekpos(pos, which) of the most derived class.2) The base class version of this function has no effect. The derived classes may override this function to allow absolute positioning of the position indicator.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | - | absolute position to set the position indicator to |
| which | - | defines which of the input and/or output sequences to affect. It can be one or a combination of the following constants:  |  |  | | --- | --- | | Constant | Explanation | | in | affect the input sequence | | out | affect the output sequence | |

### Return value

1) The return value of seekpos(pos, which).2) The resulting absolute position as defined by the position indicator. The base class version returns pos_type(off_type(-1)).

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 55 | C++98 | the base class version of `seekpos` returned an undefined invalid stream position | returns pos_type(off_type(-1)) |
