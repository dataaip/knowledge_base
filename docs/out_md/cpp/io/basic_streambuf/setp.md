| protected:  void setp( char_type\* pbeg, char_type\* pend ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Sets the values of the pointers defining the put area.

After the call, pbase() == pbeg, pptr() == pbeg and epptr() == pend are all true.

If any of ``pbeg`,`pend`)` is not a [valid range, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pbeg | - | pointer to the new beginning of the put area |
| pend | - | pointer to the new end of the put area |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <array>
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
 
// Buffer for std::ostream implemented by std::array
template<std::size_t size, class CharT = char>
struct ArrayedStreamBuffer : std::basic_streambuf<CharT>
{
    using Base = std::basic_streambuf<CharT>;
    using char_type = typename Base::char_type;
 
    ArrayedStreamBuffer()
    {
        // put area pointers to work with “buffer”
        Base::setp(buffer.data(), buffer.data() + size);
    }
 
    void print_buffer()
    {
        for (char_type i : buffer)
        {
            if (i == 0)
                std::cout << "\\0";
            else
                std::cout << i;
            std::cout << ' ';
        }
        std::cout << '\n';
    }
 
private:
    std::array<char_type, size> buffer{}; // value-initialize “buffer”
};
 
int main()
{
    ArrayedStreamBuffer<10> streambuf;
    std::ostream stream(&streambuf);
 
    stream << "hello";
    stream << ",";
 
    streambuf.print_buffer();
}

```

Output:

```
h e l l o , \0 \0 \0 \0

```

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 4023 | C++98 | `setp` did not require the output sequence to be a valid range | requires |
