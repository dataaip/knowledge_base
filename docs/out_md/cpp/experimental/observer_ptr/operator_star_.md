`operator*` and `operator->` provide access to the object watched by \*this.

The behavior of `operator*` is undefined if get() == nullptr.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1) Returns the object watched by \*this, equivalent to \*get().

2) Returns a pointer to the object watched by \*this, i.e. get().

### Exceptions

1) Throws nothing.
