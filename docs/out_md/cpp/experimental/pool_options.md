| struct pool_options {  std::size_t max_blocks_per_chunk = 0;      std::size_t largest_required_pool_block = 0; }; |  | (library fundamentals TS) |
|  |  |  |

The struct `std::experimental::pmr::pool_options` contains a set of constructor options for std::experimental::pmr::synchronized_pool_resource and std::experimental::pmr::unsynchronized_pool_resource.

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::size_t max_blocks_per_chunk | the maximum number of blocks that will be allocated at once from the upstream memory resource to replenish a pool   (public member object) |
| std::size_t largest_required_pool_block | the largest allocation size that is required to be fulfilled through the pooling mechanism   (public member object) |

If the value of `max_blocks_per_chunk` is zero or greater than an implementation-defined limit, that limit is used instead. The implementation may use a smaller value than is specified and may use different values for different pools.

If the value of `largest_required_pool_block` is zero or greater than an implementation-defined limit, that limit is used instead. The implementation may use a threshold greater than specified in this field.

| unsynchronized_pool_resource | a thread-unsafe memory_resource for managing allocations in pools of different block sizes   (class) |
