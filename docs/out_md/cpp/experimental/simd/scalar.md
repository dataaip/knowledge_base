| using scalar = /\*unspecified\*/; |  | (parallelism TS v2) |
|  |  |  |

With the `scalar` ABI tag, data-parallel types are equivalent to a single element type. However, the full `simd` and `simd_mask` interface is supported and thus eases development of generic code.

### Notes

`scalar` is **not** an alias to fixed_size<1>.
