| Defined in header `<experimental/simd>` |  |  |
| template< class T >  constexpr int max_fixed_size = /\*implementation-defined\*/; |  | (parallelism TS v2) |
|  |  |  |

The value of max_fixed_size<T> declares that an instance of simd<T, fixed_size<N>> with N <= max_fixed_size<T> is supported by the implementation. The value of max_fixed_size<T> is at least 32.

### Notes

It is unspecified whether an implementation supports simd<T, fixed_size<N>> with N > max_fixed_size<T>. The value of max_fixed_size<T> may depend on compiler flags and may change between different compiler versions.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstdint>
#include <experimental/simd>
#include <iostream>
namespace stq = std::experimental;
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << stq::simd_abi::max_fixed_size<std::uint8_t> << ' ';
    std::cout << stq::simd_abi::max_fixed_size<std::uint64_t> << ' ';
    std::cout << stq::simd_abi::max_fixed_size<float> << ' ';
    std::cout << stq::simd_abi::max_fixed_size<long double> << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
32 32 32 32

```
