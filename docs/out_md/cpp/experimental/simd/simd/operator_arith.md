Applies the given binary operator element-wise to each corresponding element of the operands. Returns a simd such that for all i in the range of ``​0​`,`[`size()``)` the ith element is equal to:

1) lhs[i] + rhs[i]2) lhs[i] - rhs[i]3) lhs[i] \* rhs[i]4) lhs[i] / rhs[i]5) lhs[i] % rhs[i]6) lhs[i] & rhs[i]7) lhs[i] | rhs[i]8) lhs[i] ^ rhs[i]9) lhs[i] << rhs[i]10) lhs[i] << n11) lhs[i] >> rhs[i]12) lhs[i] >> n

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs | - | left operands |
| rhs | - | right operands |
| n | - | number of bits to shift each element in lhs |

### Return value

A simd as described above.
