| template< int N >  struct fixed_size {}; |  | (parallelism TS v2) |
|  |  |  |

The simd_abi::fixed_size<N> tag type ensures data-parallel types to store and manipulate `N` elements (i.e. simd<T, simd_abi::fixed_size<N>>::size() returns `N`). An implementation shall support at least all `N` ∈ `[`1`,`32`]`. Additionally, for every supported simd<T, Abi>, where `Abi` is an implementation-defined ABI tag, N = simd<T, Abi>::size() shall be supported.

### Notes

An implementation may choose to forego ABI compatibility between differently compiled translation units for `simd` and `simd_mask` instantiations using the same simd_abi::fixed_size<N> tag. Otherwise, the efficiency of simd<T, Abi> is likely to be better than simd<T, fixed_size<simd_size_v<T, Abi>>> (with `Abi` not an instance of simd_abi::fixed_size).
