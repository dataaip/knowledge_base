| Defined in header `<experimental/simd>` |  |  |
| template< class V, class T, class Abi >  /\*see below\*/ simd_cast( const simd<T, Abi>& v ) noexcept; | (1) | (parallelism TS v2) |
| template< class V, class T, class Abi >  /\*see below\*/ static_simd_cast( const simd<T, Abi>& v ) noexcept; | (2) | (parallelism TS v2) |
|  |  |  |

Cast a simd object to another simd object. If V is T, returns simd<T, Abi>; otherwise, if V is a scalar type, returns simd<V, simd_abi::fixed_size<simd<T, Abi>::size()>>. Otherwise, V must be a simd type, and the function returns V.

1) This function does not participate in overloading resolution unless

- every possible value of the input element can be represented with the output element,
- either is_simd_v<V> is false, or V::size() is simd<T, Abi>::size().
2) This function does not participate in overloading resolution unless either is_simd_v<V> is false, or V::size() is simd<T, Abi>::size().

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v | - | the input simd object |

### Return value

A simd object with the i-th element initialized to static_cast<To>(v[i]), where To is the output element type as specified.

### Notes

The TS specification is missing simd_cast and static_simd_cast overloads for simd_mask. The libstdc++ implementation provides the missing overloads in the std::experimental::__proposed namespace. If you already use the

```
namespace stdx = std::experimental;

```

shortcut, you might be interested to use

```
namespace stdx {
  using namespace std::experimental;
  using namespace std::experimental::__proposed;
}

```

instead. Alternatively, libstdc++ implements a __cvt() member function in simd_mask, which allows implicit conversion of the mask. See also: <https://github.com/VcDevel/std-simd/issues/41>
