| template< class Key, class Hash, class KeyEqual, class Alloc, class Pred >  void erase_if( std::unordered_set<Key, Hash, KeyEqual, Alloc>& c, Pred pred ); |  | (library fundamentals TS v2) |
|  |  |  |

Erases all elements that satisfy the predicate pred from the container. Equivalent to

```
for (auto i = c.begin(), last = c.end(); i != last;)
{
    if (pred(*i))
        i = c.erase(i);
    else
        ++i;
}

```

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c | - | container from which to erase |
| pred | - | predicate that determines which elements should be erased |

### Complexity

Linear.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <experimental/unordered_set>
#include <iostream>
 
template<typename Os, typename Container>
inline Os& operator<<(Os& os, Container const& container)
{
    os << "{ ";
    for (const auto& item : container)
        os << item << ' ';
    return os << '}';
}
 
int main()
{
    std::unordered_set<int> data{3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 2, 1, 0};
    std::cout << "Original:\n" << data << '\n';
    auto divisible_by_3 = [](auto const& x) { return (x % 3) == 0; };
    std::experimental::erase_if(data, divisible_by_3);
    std::cout << "Erase all items divisible by 3:\n" << data << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
Original:
{ 0 1 2 7 6 5 4 3 }
Erase all items divisible by 3:
{ 1 2 7 5 4 }

```
