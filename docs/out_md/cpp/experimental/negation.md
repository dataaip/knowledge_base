| Defined in header `<experimental/type_traits>` |  |  |
| template< class B >  struct negation; | (1) | (library fundamentals TS v2) |
|  |  |  |

Forms the logical negation of the type trait `B`.

The type negation<B> is a UnaryTypeTrait with a base characteristic of std::integral_constant<bool, !bool(B::value)>.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B | - | any type such that the expression bool(B::value) is a valid constant expression |

### Helper variable template

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template< class B >  constexpr bool negation_v = negation<B>::value; |  | (library fundamentals TS v2) |
|  |  |  |

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| value[static] | true if `B` has a member `::value` such that !bool(B::value) is true, false otherwise   (public static member constant) |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator bool | converts the object to bool, returns value   (public member function) |
| operator()(C++14) | returns value   (public member function) |

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `value_type` | bool |
| `type` | std::integral_constant<bool, value> |

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class B> struct negation : std::integral_constant<bool, !bool(B::value)> {}; ``` |
