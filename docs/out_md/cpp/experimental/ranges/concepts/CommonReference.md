| template< class T, class U >  concept bool CommonReference =      Same<ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>, ranges::common_reference_t<U, T>> &&      ConvertibleTo<T, ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>> &&     ConvertibleTo<U, ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>>; |  | (ranges TS) |
|  |  |  |

The concept `CommonReference<T, U>` specifies that two types `T` and `U` share a **common reference type** (as computed by ranges::common_reference_t) to which both can be converted.

`CommonReference<T, U>` is satisfied only if, given expressions `t` and `u` such that decltype((t)) is `T` and decltype((u)) is `U`,

- ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>(t) is equal to ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>(t) if and only if `t` is an equality-preserving expression; and
- ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>(u) is equal to ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>(u) if and only if `u` is an equality-preserving expression.

In other words, the conversion to the common reference type must not alter the equality-preservation property of the original expression.

### Equality preservation

An expression is **equality preserving** if it results in equal outputs given equal inputs.

- The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
- The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands modified by the expression (if any).

Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required to be **stable**: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening modification of those input objects.
