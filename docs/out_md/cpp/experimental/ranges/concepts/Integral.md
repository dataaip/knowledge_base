| Defined in header `<experimental/ranges/concepts>` |  |  |
| template< class T >  concept bool Integral = std::is_integral<T>::value; |  | (ranges TS) |
|  |  |  |

The concept Integral<T> is satisfied if and only if `T` is an integral type.

There need not be any subsumption relationship between Integral<T> and std::is_integral<T>::value.
