|  |  |  |

Returns the number of elements in the range ``first`,`last`)` satisfying specific criteria.

1) Counts the elements whose projected values are equal to value (i.e., [ranges::invoke(proj, \*i) == value).3) Counts the elements whose projected values satisfy the predicate pred (i.e., ranges::invoke(pred, ranges::invoke(proj, \*i)) != false).2,4) Same as (1,3), but uses r as the source range, as if using ranges::begin(r) as first and ranges::end(r) as last.

Notwithstanding the declarations depicted above, the actual number and order of template parameters for algorithm declarations is unspecified. Thus, if explicit template arguments are used when calling an algorithm, the program is probably non-portable.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the range of elements to examine |
| r | - | the range of elements to examine |
| value | - | the value to search for |
| pred | - | predicate to apply to the projected elements |
| proj | - | projection to apply to the elements |

### Return value

Number of elements satisfying the condition.

### Complexity

Exactly last - first comparisons / applications of the predicate, and the same number of applications of the projection.

### Notes

For the number of elements in the range ``first`,`last`)` without any additional criteria, see [ranges::distance.

### Possible implementation

| First version |
| --- |
| ```text template<InputIterator I, Sentinel<I> S, class T, class Proj = ranges::identity>     requires IndirectRelation<ranges::equal_to<>, projected<I, Proj>, const T*> ranges::difference_type_t<I> count(I first, S last, const T& value, Proj proj = Proj{}) {     ranges::difference_type_t<I> ret = 0;     for (; first != last; ++first)         if (ranges::invoke(proj, *first) == value)             ++ret;     return ret; } ``` |
| Second version |
| ```text template<InputIterator I, Sentinel<I> S, class Proj = ranges::identity,          IndirectUnaryPredicate<projected<I, Proj>> Pred> ranges::difference_type_t<I> count_if(I first, S last, Pred pred, Proj proj = Proj{}) {     ranges::difference_type_t<I> ret = 0;     for (; first != last; ++first)         if (ranges::invoke(pred, ranges::invoke(proj, *i)))             ++ret;     return ret; } ``` |
