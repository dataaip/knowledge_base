1) Searches the range ``first`,`last`)` for the first sequence of count elements whose projected values are each equal to the given value value according to the predicate pred.2) Same as (1), but uses r as the source range, as if using [ranges::begin(r) as first and ranges::end(r) as last.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the range of elements to examine |
| r | - | the range of elements to examine |
| count | - | the length of the sequence to search for |
| value | - | the value to search for |
| pred | - | the predicate that compares the projected elements with value |
| proj | - | the projection to apply to the elements |

### Return value

Iterator to the beginning of the found sequence in the range ``first`,`last`)`. If no such sequence is found, an iterator that compares equal to last is returned.

### Complexity

At most last - first applications of the predicate and the projection.
