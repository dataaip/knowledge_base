1) Searches the range ``first1`,`last1`)` for any of the elements in the range `[`first2`,`last2`)`, after projecting the ranges with proj1 and proj2 respectively. The projected elements are compared using pred.2) Same as (1), but uses r1 as the first source range and r2 as the second source range, as if using [ranges::begin(r1) as first1, ranges::end(r1) as last1, ranges::begin(r2) as first2, and ranges::end(r2) as last2.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first1, last1 | - | the range of elements to examine |
| r1 | - | the range of elements to examine |
| first2, last2 | - | the range of elements to search for |
| r2 | - | the range of elements to search for |
| pred | - | predicate to use to compare the projected elements with |
| proj1 | - | projection to apply to the elements in the first range |
| proj2 | - | projection to apply to the elements in the second range |

### Return value

Iterator to the first element in the range ``first1`,`last1`)` that is equal to an element from the range `[`first2`,`last2`)` after projection. If no such element is found, an iterator comparing equal to last1 is returned.

### Complexity

At most `(S * N)` applications of the predicate and each projection, where S = distance(last2 - first2) and N = last1 - first1.
