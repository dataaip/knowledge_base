| template< TaggedType T1, TaggedType T2 >  using tagged_pair = /\* see below \*/; |  | (ranges TS) |
|  |  |  |

Convenience alias template for naming a `ranges::tagged` wrapping a std::pair.

A `TaggedType` is a function type `S(T)`, where `S` is a `TagSpecifier` and `T` is the type of the element.

tagged_pair<S1(T1), S2(T2)> is an alias for ranges::tagged<std::pair<T1, T2>, S1, S2>.

### Notes

Because a function type is used to "glue" the tag specifier and the corresponding element type together, the usual parameter type adjustments apply. In particular, top-level cv-qualifiers are removed and array types are adjusted to pointers: tagged_pair<tag::in(const int\* const), tag::out(int[])> is ranges::tagged<std::pair<const int\*, int\*>, tag::in, tag::out>.
