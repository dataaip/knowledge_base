| Call signature |  |  |

Advances the iterator i n times, or until bound is reached, whichever comes first, and returns the advanced iterator.

1) Equivalent to ++i; return i;.2) Equivalent to ranges::advance(i, n); return i;.3) Equivalent to ranges::advance(i, bound); return i;.4) Equivalent to ranges::advance(i, n, bound); return i;.

### Customization point objects

The name `ranges::next` denotes a **customization point object**, which is a function object of a literal `Semiregular` class type (denoted, for exposition purposes, as `NextT`). All instances of `NextT` are equal. Thus, `ranges::next` can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types `Args...`, if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to `ranges::next` above, `NextT` will satisfy ranges::Invocable<const NextT, Args...>. Otherwise, no function call operator of `NextT` participates in overload resolution.

In every translation unit in which `ranges::next` is defined, it refers to the same instance of the customization point object. (This means that it can be used freely in things like inline functions and function templates without violating the one-definition rule.)

### Return value

The advanced iterator.

### Notes

Even though omitting n for overload (2) behaves as if n is 1, omitting n for overload (4) effectively behaves as if n is infinity (always advance to bound).
