| memory_resource\* new_delete_resource() noexcept; |  | (library fundamentals TS) |
|  |  |  |

Returns a pointer to a `memory_resource` that uses the global operator new and operator delete to allocate memory.

### Return value

Returns a pointer `p` to a static storage duration object of a type derived from std::experimental::pmr::memory_resource, with the following properties:

- its `allocate()` function uses `::operator new` to allocate memory;
- its `deallocate()` function uses `::operator delete` to deallocate memory;
- for any `memory_resource` `r`, `p->is_equal(r)` returns `&r == p`.

The same value is returned every time this function is called.
