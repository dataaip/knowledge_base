1) Computes the (physicist's) Hermite polynomials of the degree n and argument x.2) A set of overloads or a function template accepting an argument of any integral type. Equivalent to (1) after casting the argument to double.

As all special functions, `hermite` is only guaranteed to be available in `<cmath>` if `__STDCPP_MATH_SPEC_FUNCS__` is defined by the implementation to a value at least 201003L and if the user defines `__STDCPP_WANT_MATH_SPEC_FUNCS__` before including any standard library headers.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | - | the degree of the polynomial |
| x | - | the argument, a value of a floating-point or integral type |

### Return value

If no errors occur, value of the order-nHermite polynomial of x, that is (-1)n  
**e**x2

|  |
| --- |
| dn |
| dxn |

**e**-x2, is returned.

### Error handling

Errors may be reported as specified in math_errhandling.

- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned and domain error is not reported.
- If n is greater or equal than 128, the behavior is implementation-defined.

### Notes

Implementations that do not support TR 29124 but support TR 19768, provide this function in the header `tr1/cmath` and namespace `std::tr1`.

An implementation of this function is also available in boost.math.

The Hermite polynomials are the polynomial solutions of the equation
u,,  
 - 2xu,  
 = -2nu.

The first few are:

- hermite(0, x) = 1.
- hermite(1, x) = 2x.
- hermite(2, x) = 4x2  
   - 2.
- hermite(3, x) = 8x3  
   - 12x.
- hermite(4, x) = 16x4  
   - 48x2  
   + 12.

### Example

(works as shown with gcc 6.0)

Run this code

```
#define __STDCPP_WANT_MATH_SPEC_FUNCS__ 1
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
 
double H3(double x)
{
    return 8 * std::pow(x, 3) - 12 * x;
}
 
double H4(double x)
{
    return 16 * std::pow(x, 4) - 48 * x * x + 12;
}
 
int main()
{
    // spot-checks
    std::cout << std::hermite(3, 10) << '=' << H3(10) << '\n'
              << std::hermite(4, 10) << '=' << H4(10) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
7880=7880
155212=155212

```
