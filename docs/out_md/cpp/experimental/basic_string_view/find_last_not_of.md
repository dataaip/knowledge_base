Finds the last character not equal to any of the characters in the given character sequence.

1) Finds the last character not equal to any of the characters of `v` in this view, starting at position `pos`.2) Equivalent to find_last_not_of(basic_string_view(&c, 1), pos).3) Equivalent to find_last_not_of(basic_string_view(s, count), pos).4) Equivalent to find_last_not_of(basic_string_view(s), pos).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v | - | view to search for |
| pos | - | position at which to start the search |
| count | - | length of the string of characters to compare |
| s | - | pointer to a string of characters to compare |
| ch | - | character to compare |

### Return value

Position of the last character not equal to any of the characters in the given string, or npos if no such character is found.

### Complexity

O(`size()` \* `v.size()`) at worst.
