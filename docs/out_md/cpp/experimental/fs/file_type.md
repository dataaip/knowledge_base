### Constants

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Constant | Meaning |
| `none` | indicates that the file status has not been evaluated yet, or an error occurred when evaluating it |
| `not_found` | indicates that the file was not found (this is not considered an error) |
| `regular` | a regular file |
| `directory` | a directory |
| `symlink` | a symbolic link |
| `block` | a block special file |
| `character` | a character special file |
| `fifo` | a FIFO (also known as pipe) file |
| `socket` | a socket file |
| `unknown` | an unknown file |
