| path root_path() const; |  | (filesystem TS) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the root path of the path. If the path does not include root path, returns path().

Effectively, returns the following:
root_name() / root_directory()

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The root path of the path.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Current root path is: " << fs::current_path().root_path() << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
Current root path is: "C:\"

```
