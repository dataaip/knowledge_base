| Defined in header `<experimental/filesystem>` |  |  |
| void create_symlink( const path& target, const path& link );  void create_symlink( const path& target, const path& link, error_code& ec ); | (1) | (filesystem TS) |
| void create_directory_symlink( const path& target, const path& link );  void create_directory_symlink( const path& target, const path& link, error_code& ec ); | (2) | (filesystem TS) |
|  |  |  |

Creates a symbolic link link with its target set to target as if by POSIX symlink(): the pathname target may be invalid or non-existing.

Some operating systems require symlink creation to identify that the link is to a directory. Portable code should use (2) to create directory symlinks rather than (1), even though there is no distinction on POSIX systems.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| target | - | path to point the symlink to, does not have to exist |
| link | - | path of the new symbolic link |
| ec | - | out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload |

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

The overload that does not take an error_code& parameter throws filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with target as the first argument, link as the second argument, and the OS error code as the error code argument. std::bad_alloc may be thrown if memory allocation fails. The overload taking an error_code& parameter sets it to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur. This overload hasnoexcept specification:noexcept

### Notes

Some operating systems do not support symbolic links at all or support them only for regular files.

Some file systems do not support symbolic links regardless of the operating system, for example the FAT system used on some memory cards and flash drives.

Like a hard link, a symbolic link allows a file to have multiple logical names. The presence of a hard link guarantees the existence of a file, even after the original name has been removed. A symbolic link provides no such assurance; in fact, the file named by the target argument need not exist when the link is created. A symbolic link can cross file system boundaries.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
    fs::create_directories("sandbox/subdir");
    fs::create_symlink("target", "sandbox/sym1");
    fs::create_directory_symlink("subdir", "sandbox/sym2");
 
    for (auto it = fs::directory_iterator("sandbox"); it != fs::directory_iterator(); ++it)
        if (is_symlink(it->symlink_status()))
            std::cout << *it << "->" << read_symlink(*it) << '\n';
 
    fs::remove_all("sandbox");
}

```

Possible output:

```
"sandbox/sym1"->"target"
"sandbox/sym2"->"subdir"

```
