| Defined in header `<experimental/filesystem>` |  |  |
| void resize_file( const path& p, std::uintmax_t new_size );  void resize_file( const path& p, std::uintmax_t new_size, error_code& ec ); |  | (filesystem TS) |
|  |  |  |

Changes the size of the regular file named by p as if by POSIX truncate: if the file size was previously larger than new_size, the remainder of the file is discarded. If the file was previously smaller than new_size, the file size is increased and the new area appears as if zero-filled.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p | - | path to resize |
| new_size | - | size that the file will now have |
| ec | - | out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload |

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

The overload that does not take an error_code& parameter throws filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first argument and the OS error code as the error code argument. std::bad_alloc may be thrown if memory allocation fails. The overload taking an error_code& parameter sets it to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur. This overload hasnoexcept specification:noexcept

### Notes

On systems that support sparse files, increasing the file size does not increase the space it occupies on the file system: space allocation takes place only when non-zero bytes are written to the file.

### Example

Demonstrates the effect of creating a sparse file on the free space.

Run this code

```
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
    fs::path p = fs::temp_directory_path() / "example.bin";
    std::ofstream(p).put('a');
    std::cout << "File size:  " << fs::file_size(p) << '\n'
              << "Free space: " << fs::space(p).free << '\n';
    fs::resize_file(p, 64*1024); // resize to 64 KB
    std::cout << "File size:  " << fs::file_size(p) << '\n'
              << "Free space: " << fs::space(p).free << '\n';
    fs::remove(p);
}

```

Possible output:

```
File size:  1
Free space: 31805444096
File size:  65536
Free space: 31805444096

```
