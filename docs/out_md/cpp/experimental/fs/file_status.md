### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a `file_status` object   (public member function) |
| operator= | assigns contents   (public member function) |
| (destructor) | implicit destructor   (public member function) |
| type | gets or sets the type of the file   (public member function) |
| permissions | gets or sets the permissions of the file   (public member function) |
