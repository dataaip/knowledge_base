1) Invoke the Callable object f with the parameters args as by `INVOKE`(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...). This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_invocable_v<F, Args...> is true.2) Invoke the Callable object f with the parameters args as by `INVOKE<R>`(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...). This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_invocable_r_v<R, F, Args...> is true.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| f | - | Callable object to be invoked |
| args | - | arguments to pass to f |

### Return value

1) The value returned by f.2) The value returned by f, implicitly converted to `R`, if `R` is not (possibly cv-qualified) void. None otherwise.

### Exceptions

1)noexcept specification:noexcept(std::is_nothrow_invocable_v<F, Args...>)2)noexcept specification:noexcept(std::is_nothrow_invocable_r_v<R, F, Args...>)

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_invoke` | `201411L` | (C++17) | `std::invoke`, (1) |
| `__cpp_lib_invoke_r` | `202106L` | (C++23) | `std::invoke_r`, (2) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>
 
struct Foo
{
    Foo(int num) : num_(num) {}
    void print_add(int i) const { std::cout << num_ + i << '\n'; }
    int num_;
};
 
void print_num(int i)
{
    std::cout << i << '\n';
}
 
struct PrintNum
{
    void operator()(int i) const
    {
        std::cout << i << '\n';
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "invoke a free function: ";
    std::invoke(print_num, -9);
 
    std::cout << "invoke a lambda: ";
    std::invoke([](){ print_num(42); });
 
    std::cout << "invoke a member function: ";
    const Foo foo(314159);
    std::invoke(&Foo::print_add, foo, 1);
 
    std::cout << "invoke (i.e., access) a data member num_: "
              << std::invoke(&Foo::num_, foo) << '\n';
 
    std::cout << "invoke a function object: ";
    std::invoke(PrintNum(), 18);
 
#if defined(__cpp_lib_invoke_r)
    auto add = [](int x, int y){ return x + y; };
    std::cout << "invoke a lambda converting result to float: ";
    auto ret = std::invoke_r<float>(add, 11, 22);
    static_assert(std::is_same<decltype(ret), float>());
    std::cout << std::fixed << ret << "\ninvoke print_num: ";
    std::invoke_r<void>(print_num, 44);
#endif
}

```

Possible output:

```
invoke a free function: -9
invoke a lambda: 42
invoke a member function: 314160
invoke (i.e., access) a data member num_: 314159
invoke a function object: 18
invoke a lambda converting result to float: 33.000000
invoke print_num: 44

```
