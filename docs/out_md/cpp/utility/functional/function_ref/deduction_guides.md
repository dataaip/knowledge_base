1) This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_function_v<F> is true.2) Let type F be std::remove_pointer_t<decltype(f)>. This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_function_v<F> is true. The deduced type is std::function_ref<F>.3) Let type F be decltype(f). This overload participates in overload resolution only if :

- F is of the form R(G::\*)(A...) noexcept(E) (optionally cv-qualified, optionally noexcept, optionally lvalue reference qualified) for a type G, or
- F is of the form M G::\* for a type G and an object type M, in which case let R be std::invoke_result_t<F, T&>, A... be an empty pack, and E be false, or
- F is of the form R(\*)(G, A...) noexcept(E) for a type G.

:   :   The deduced type is std::function_ref<R(A...) noexcept(E)>.
