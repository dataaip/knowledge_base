If \*this contains a value, invokes `f` with the contained value as an argument, and returns an `std::optional` that contains the result of that invocation; otherwise, returns an empty `std::optional`.

The type of contained value in the result (denoted by `U` below) must be a non-array object type, and must not be std::in_place_t or std::nullopt_t). Otherwise, the program is ill-formed.

1) Let `U` be std::remove_cv_t<std::invoke_result_t<F, T&>>. If \*this contains a value, returns a std::optional<U> whose contained value is direct-initialized from std::invoke(std::forward<F>(f), \*\*this) (unlike `and_then()`, which must return an std::optional directly). Otherwise, returns an empty std::optional<U>.  
The program is ill-formed if the variable definition U x(std::invoke(std::forward<F>(f), \*\*this)); is ill-formed.2) Same as (1), except that `U` is std::remove_cv_t<std::invoke_result_t<F, const T&>>.3) Let `U` be std::remove_cv_t<std::invoke_result_t<F, T>>. If \*this contains a value, returns a std::optional<U> whose contained value is direct-initialized from std::invoke(std::forward<F>(f), std::move(\*\*this)). Otherwise, returns an empty std::optional<U>.  
The program is ill-formed if the variable definition U x(std::invoke(std::forward<F>(f), std::move(\*\*this))); is ill-formed.4) Same as (3), except that `U` is std::remove_cv_t<std::invoke_result_t<F, const T>>.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| f | - | a suitable function or Callable object whose call signature returns a non-reference type |

### Return value

An std::optional containing the result of `f` or an empty std::optional, as described above.

### Notes

Because `transform` directly constructs a `U` object at the right location, rather than passing it to a constructor, std::is_move_constructible_v<U> can be false.

As the callable `f` can't return a reference type, it cannot be a pointer to data member.

Some languages call this operation **map** "enwiki:Map (higher-order function)").

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <optional>
 
struct A { /* ... */ };
struct B { /* ... */ };
struct C { /* ... */ };
struct D { /* ... */ };
 
auto A_to_B(A) -> B { /* ... */ std::cout << "A => B \n"; return {}; }
auto B_to_C(B) -> C { /* ... */ std::cout << "B => C \n"; return {}; }
auto C_to_D(C) -> D { /* ... */ std::cout << "C => D \n"; return {}; }
 
void try_transform_A_to_D(std::optional<A> o_A)
{
    std::cout << (o_A ? "o_A has a value\n" : "o_A is empty\n");
 
    std::optional<D> o_D = o_A.transform(A_to_B)
                              .transform(B_to_C)
                              .transform(C_to_D);
 
    std::cout << (o_D ? "o_D has a value\n\n" : "o_D is empty\n\n");
};
 
int main()
{
    try_transform_A_to_D( A{} );
    try_transform_A_to_D( {} );
}

```

Output:

```
o_A has a value
A => B
B => C
C => D
o_D has a value
 
o_A is empty
o_D is empty

```
