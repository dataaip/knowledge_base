| Defined in header `<variant>` |  |  |
| template< class... Types >  struct hash<std::variant<Types...>>; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

The template specialization of std::hash for the std::variant template allows users to obtain hashes of `variant` objects.

The specialization `std::hash`<std::variant<Types...>> is enabled (see std::hash) if every specialization in `std::hash`<std::remove_const_t<Types>>... is enabled, and is disabled otherwise.

The member functions of this specialization are not guaranteed to be noexcept.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Types | - | the types of the alternatives supported by the `variant` object |

### Notes

Unlike std::hash<std::optional>, hash of a variant does not typically equal the hash of the contained value; this makes it possible to distinguish std::variant<int, int> holding the same value as different alternatives.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <variant>
 
using Var = std::variant<int, int, int, std::string>;
 
template<unsigned I>
void print(Var const& var)
{
    std::cout << "get<" << var.index() << "> = "
              << std::get<I>(var)
              << "\t" "# = "
              << std::hash<Var>{}(var) << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    Var var;
    std::get<0>(var) = 2020;
    print<0>(var);
    var.emplace<1>(2023);
    print<1>(var);
    var.emplace<2>(2026);
    print<2>(var);
    var = "C++";
    print<3>(var);
}

```

Possible output:

```
get<0> = 2020   # = 2020
get<1> = 2023   # = 2024
get<2> = 2026   # = 2028
get<3> = C++    # = 15518724754199266859

```
