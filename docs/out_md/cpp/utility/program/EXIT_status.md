| Defined in header `<cstdlib>` |  |  |
| #define EXIT_SUCCESS /\*implementation defined\*/ |  |  |
| #define EXIT_FAILURE /\*implementation defined\*/ |  |  |
|  |  |  |

The `EXIT_SUCCESS` and `EXIT_FAILURE` macros expand into integral constant expressions that can be used as arguments to the std::exit function (and, therefore, as the values to return from the main function), and indicate program execution status.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| A freestanding implementation is required to provide `EXIT_SUCCESS` and `EXIT_FAILURE`. | (since C++23) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Constant | Description |
| `EXIT_SUCCESS` | successful execution of a program |
| `EXIT_FAILURE` | unsuccessful execution of a program |

### Notes

Both `EXIT_SUCCESS` and the value zero indicate successful program execution status (see std::exit), although it is not required that `EXIT_SUCCESS` equals zero.

Although `EXIT_SUCCESS` and `EXIT_FAILURE` are required to be freestanding since C++23, they are not required to be available in a freestanding C implementation.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
 
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    if (argc <= 1)
    {
        std::cout << "At least one command-line argument required\n";
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
 
    std::cout << argv[1] << '\n';
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

```

Possible output:

```
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy cat

```
