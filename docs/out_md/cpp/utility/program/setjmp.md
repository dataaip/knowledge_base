| Defined in header `<csetjmp>` |  |  |
| #define setjmp(env) /\* implementation-defined \*/ |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Saves the current execution context into a variable env of type std::jmp_buf. This variable can later be used to restore the current execution context by std::longjmp function. That is, when a call to std::longjmp function is made, the execution continues at the particular call site that constructed the std::jmp_buf variable passed to std::longjmp. In that case `setjmp` returns the value passed to std::longjmp.

The invocation of `setjmp` must appear only in one of the following contexts:

1. the entire controlling expression of if, switch, while, do-while, for.

   ```
   switch (setjmp(env)) { // ...
   
```
2. one operand of a relational or equality operator with the other operand an integer constant expression, with the resulting expression being the entire controlling expression of if, switch, while, do-while, for.

   ```
   if (setjmp(env) > 0) { // ...
   
```
3. the operand of a unary ! operator with the resulting expression being the entire controlling expression of if, switch, while, do-while, for.

   ```
   while (!setjmp(env)) { // ...
   
```
4. the entire expression of an expression statement (possibly cast to void).

   ```
   setjmp(env);
   
```

If `setjmp` appears in any other context, the behavior is undefined.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Additionally, the behavior is undefined if `setjmp` is invoked in a coroutine in a place where the co_await operator may be used. | (since C++20) |

Upon return to the scope of `setjmp`:

- all accessible objects, floating-point status flags, and other components of the abstract machine have the same values as they had when std::longjmp was executed,
- except for the non-volatile local variables in the function containing the invocation of `setjmp`, whose values are indeterminate if they have been changed since the `setjmp` invocation.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| env | - | variable to save the execution state of the program to |

### Return value

​0​ if the macro was called by the original code and the execution context was saved to env.

Non-zero value if a non-local jump was just performed. The return value is the same as passed to std::longjmp.

### Notes

Above requirements forbid using return value of `setjmp` in data flow (e.g. to initialize or assign an object with it). The return value can only be either used in control flow or discarded.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <array>
#include <cmath>
#include <csetjmp>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <format>
#include <iostream>
 
std::jmp_buf solver_error_handler;
 
std::array<double, 2> solve_quadratic_equation(double a, double b, double c)
{
    const double discriminant = b * b - 4.0 * a * c;
    if (discriminant < 0)
        std::longjmp(solver_error_handler, true); // Go to error handler
 
    const double delta = std::sqrt(discriminant) / (2.0 * a);
    const double argmin = -b / (2.0 * a);
    return {argmin - delta, argmin + delta};
}
 
void show_quadratic_equation_solution(double a, double b, double c)
{
    std::cout << std::format("Solving {}x² + {}x + {} = 0...\n", a, b, c);
    auto [x_0, x_1] = solve_quadratic_equation(a, b, c);
    std::cout << std::format("x₁ = {}, x₂ = {}\n\n", x_0, x_1);
}
 
int main()
{
    if (setjmp(solver_error_handler))
    {
        // Error handler for solver
        std::cout << "No real solution\n";
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
 
    for (auto [a, b, c] : {std::array{1, -3, 2}, {2, -3, -2}, {1, 2, 3}})
        show_quadratic_equation_solution(a, b, c);
 
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

```

Output:

```
Solving 1x² + -3x + 2 = 0...
x₁ = 1, x₂ = 2
 
Solving 2x² + -3x + -2 = 0...
x₁ = -0.5, x₂ = 2
 
Solving 1x² + 2x + 3 = 0...
No real solution

```
