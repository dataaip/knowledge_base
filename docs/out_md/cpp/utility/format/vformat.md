| std::string vformat( std::string_view fmt, std::format_args args ); | (1) | (since C++20) |
| std::wstring vformat( std::wstring_view fmt, std::wformat_args args ); | (2) | (since C++20) |
| std::string vformat( const std::locale& loc,                       std::string_view fmt, std::format_args args ); | (3) | (since C++20) |
| std::wstring vformat( const std::locale& loc,                        std::wstring_view fmt, std::wformat_args args ); | (4) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Format arguments held by args according to the format string fmt, and return the result as a string. If present, loc is used for locale-specific formatting.

| fmt | - | an object that represents the format string. The format string consists of  - ordinary characters (except { and }), which are copied unchanged to the output, - escape sequences {{ and }}, which are replaced with { and } respectively in the output, and - replacement fields.   Each replacement field has the following format:   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  | | | | | | | | | | | `{` arg-id (optional) `}` | (1) |  | |  | | | | | | | | | | | `{` arg-id (optional) `:` format-spec `}` | (2) |  | |  | | | | | | | | | |  1) replacement field without a format specification2) replacement field with a format specification  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | arg-id | - | specifies the index of the argument in `args` whose value is to be used for formatting; if it is omitted, the arguments are used in order. The arg-id ﻿s in a format string must all be present or all be omitted. Mixing manual and automatic indexing is an error. | | format-spec | - | the format specification defined by the std::formatter specialization for the corresponding argument. Cannot start with }. |      - For basic types and standard string types, the format specification is interpreted as standard format specification. - For chrono types, the format specification is interpreted as chrono format specification.  |  |  | | --- | --- | | - For range types, the format specification is interpreted as range format specification. - For std::pair and std::tuple, the format specification is interpreted as tuple format specification. - For std::thread::id and std::stacktrace_entry, see thread id format specification and stacktrace entry format specification. - For std::basic_stacktrace, no format specifier is allowed. | (since C++23) |  |  |  | | --- | --- | | - For std::filesystem::path, see path format specification. | (since C++26) |  - For other formattable types, the format specification is determined by user-defined `formatter` specializations. |
| args | - | arguments to be formatted |
| loc | - | std::locale used for locale-specific formatting |

### Return value

A string object holding the formatted result.

### Exceptions

Throws std::format_error if fmt is not a valid format string for the provided arguments, or std::bad_alloc on allocation failure. Also propagates any exception thrown by formatter or iterator operations.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <format>
#include <iostream>
 
template<typename... Args>
inline void println(const std::format_string<Args...> fmt, Args&&... args)
{
    std::cout << std::vformat(fmt.get(), std::make_format_args(args...)) << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    println("{}{} {}{}", "Hello", ',', "C++", -1 + 2 * 3 * 4);
}

```

Output:

```
Hello, C++23

```
