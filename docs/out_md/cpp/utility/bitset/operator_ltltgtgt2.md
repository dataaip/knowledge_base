|  |  |  |

Inserts or extracts a bitset from a character stream.

1) Writes the bitset x to the character stream os as if by first converting it to a std::basic_string<CharT, Traits> using to_string(), and then writing it into os using the operator<< (which is a FormattedOutputFunction for strings).  
The characters to use for ones and zeroes are obtained from the currently-imbued locale by calling std::use_facet<std::ctype<CharT>>(os.getloc()).widen() with '1' and '0' as arguments.2) Behaves as a FormattedInputFunction. After constructing and checking the sentry object, which may skip leading whitespace, extracts up to N characters from is and stores the characters in the bitset x.  
Characters are extracted until either

- N characters have been read,
- end-of-file occurs in is, or
- the next character is neither is.widen('0') nor is.widen('1').

If N > 0 and no characters are extracted, is.setstate(ios_base::failbit) is called.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| os | - | the character stream to write to |
| is | - | the character stream to read from |
| x | - | the bitset to be read or written |

### Return value

1) os2) is

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
    std::string bit_string = "001101";
    std::istringstream bit_stream(bit_string);
 
    std::bitset<3> b1;
    bit_stream >> b1; // reads "001", stream still holds "101"
    std::cout << b1 << '\n';
 
    std::bitset<8> b2;
    bit_stream >> b2; // reads "101", populates the 8-bit set as "00000101"
    std::cout << b2 << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
001
00000101

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 303 | C++98 | single-byte characters were extracted from is, but `CharT` can have multiple bytes | extracts `CharT` and compares it with widened '0' and '1' |
| LWG 396 | C++98 | the content written by operator<< was locale-independent | writes widened '0's and '1's |
| LWG 3199 | C++98 | extracting a `std::bitset<0>` always sets `failbit` | such extraction never sets `failbit` |
