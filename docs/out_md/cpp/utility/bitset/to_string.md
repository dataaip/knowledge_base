|  |  |  |

Converts the contents of the bitset to a string. Uses zero to represent bits with value of false and one to represent bits with value of true.

The resulting string contains N characters with the first character corresponds to the last (N-1th) bit and the last character corresponding to the first bit.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| All template type arguments need to be provided because function templates cannot have default template arguments. Overloads (2-4) are provided to simplify the invocations of `to_string`: 2) Uses the default allocator std::allocator.3) Uses the default character trait std::char_traits and the default allocator std::allocator.4) Uses the default character type char, the default character trait std::char_traits and the default allocator std::allocator. | (until C++11) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| zero | - | character to use to represent false |
| one | - | character to use to represent true |

### Return value

1) The converted string.2) to_string<CharT, Traits, std::allocator<CharT>>(zero, one).3) to_string<CharT, std::char_traits<CharT>, std::allocator<CharT>>(zero, one).4) to_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char>>(zero, one).

### Exceptions

May throw std::bad_alloc from the std::basic_string constructor.

### Notes

Since C++11, functions templates can have default template arguments. LWG issue 1113 removed the helper overloads (2-4) and added the corresponding default template arguments in (1).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::bitset<8> b{42};
    std::cout << b.to_string() << '\n'
              << b.to_string('*') << '\n'
              << b.to_string('O', 'X') << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
00101010
**1*1*1*
OOXOXOXO

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 396 | C++98 | zero and one bits were converted to characters ​0​ and 1 (which do not correspond to '0' and '1') | added parameters to provide values for these characters |
| LWG 434 | C++98 | all template arguments needed to be provided | added overloads (2-4) |
| LWG 853 | C++98 | overloads (2-4) did not have the default arguments added by LWG issue 396 | also added |
