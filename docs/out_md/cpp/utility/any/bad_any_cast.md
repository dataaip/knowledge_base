|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<any>` |  |  |
| class bad_any_cast : public std::bad_cast; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Defines a type of object to be thrown by the value-returning forms of std::any_cast on failure.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a new `bad_any_cast` object   (public member function) |
| operator= | replaces the `bad_any_cast` object   (public member function) |
| what | returns the explanatory string   (public member function) |

## std::bad_any_cast::bad_any_cast

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bad_any_cast() noexcept; | (1) | (since C++17) |
| bad_any_cast( const bad_any_cast& other ) noexcept; | (2) | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Constructs a new `bad_any_cast` object with an implementation-defined null-terminated byte string which is accessible through what().

1) Default constructor.2) Copy constructor. If \*this and other both have dynamic type `std::bad_any_cast` then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | another exception object to copy |

## std::bad_any_cast::operator=

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bad_any_cast& operator=( const bad_any_cast& other ) noexcept; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Assigns the contents with those of other.If \*this and other both have dynamic type `std::bad_any_cast` then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | another exception object to assign with |

### Return value

\*this

## std::bad_any_cast::what

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| virtual const char\* what() const noexcept; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the explanatory string.

### Return value

Pointer to an implementation-defined null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member function (e.g. copy assignment operator) on the exception object is called.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The returned string is encoded with the ordinary literal encoding during constant evaluation. | (since C++26) |

### Notes

Implementations are allowed but not required to override `what()`.

## Inherited from std::bad_cast

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (destructor)[virtual] | destroys the exception object   (virtual public member function of `std::exception`) |
| what[virtual] | returns an explanatory string   (virtual public member function of `std::exception`) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <any>
#include <cassert>
#include <print>
 
int main()
{
    auto x = std::any(42);
    assert(std::any_cast<int>(x) == 42); // OK
 
    try
    {
        [[maybe_unused]] auto s = std::any_cast<std::string>(x); // throws
    }
    catch (const std::bad_any_cast& ex)
    {
        std::println("{}", ex.what());
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
bad any_cast

```
