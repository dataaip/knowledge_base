| void swap( any& lhs, any& rhs ) noexcept; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Overloads the std::swap algorithm for std::any. Swaps the content of two `any` objects by calling lhs.swap(rhs).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | objects to swap |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <any>
#include <print>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::any p = 42, q = std::string{"Bishop"};
    std::println("p: {}, q: {}", std::any_cast<int>(p), std::any_cast<std::string&>(q));
    std::println("swap(p, q)");
    std::swap(p, q);
    std::println("p: {}, q: {}", std::any_cast<std::string&>(p), std::any_cast<int>(q));
}

```

Output:

```
p: 42, q: Bishop
swap(p, q)
p: Bishop, q: 42

```
