| Defined in header `<tuple>` |  |  |
| void swap( tuple& other ) noexcept(/\* see below \*/); | (1) | (since C++11)  (constexpr since C++20) |
| constexpr void swap( const tuple& other ) noexcept(/\* see below \*/) const; | (2) | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Calls `swap` (which might be std::swap, or might be found via ADL) for each element in \*this and its corresponding element in other.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| If any selected `swap` function call is ill-formed, or does not swap the corresponding elements of both tuples, the behavior is undefined. | (until C++23) |
| If any selected `swap` function call does not swap the corresponding elements of both tuples, the behavior is undefined. 1) The program is ill-formed if (std::is_swappable_v<Types> && ...) is not true.2) The program is ill-formed if (std::is_swappable_v<const Types> && ...) is not true. | (since C++23) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | tuple of values to swap |

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| noexcept specification:noexcept(  noexcept(swap(std::declval<T0&>>(), std::declval<T0&>())) &&      noexcept(swap(std::declval<T1&>>(), std::declval<T1&>())) &&      noexcept(swap(std::declval<T2&>>(), std::declval<T2&>())) &&      ... ) In the expression above, the identifier `swap` is looked up in the same manner as the one used by the C++17 std::is_nothrow_swappable trait. | (until C++17) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <tuple>
 
int main()
{
    std::tuple<int, std::string, float> p1{42, "ABCD", 2.71}, p2;
    p2 = std::make_tuple(10, "1234", 3.14);
 
    auto print_p1_p2 = &
    {
        std::cout << rem
                  << "p1 = {" << std::get<0>(p1)
                  << ", "     << std::get<1>(p1)
                  << ", "     << std::get<2>(p1) << "}, "
                  << "p2 = {" << std::get<0>(p2)
                  << ", "     << std::get<1>(p2)
                  << ", "     << std::get<2>(p2) << "}\n";
    };
 
    print_p1_p2("Before p1.swap(p2): ");
    p1.swap(p2);
    print_p1_p2("After  p1.swap(p2): ");
    swap(p1, p2);
    print_p1_p2("After swap(p1, p2): ");
}

```

Output:

```
Before p1.swap(p2): p1 = {42, ABCD, 2.71}, p2 = {10, 1234, 3.14}
After  p1.swap(p2): p1 = {10, 1234, 3.14}, p2 = {42, ABCD, 2.71}
After swap(p1, p2): p1 = {42, ABCD, 2.71}, p2 = {10, 1234, 3.14}

```
