| Defined in header `<utility>` |  |  |
| template< class T1, class T2 >  struct tuple_size<std::pair<T1, T2>> : std::integral_constant<std::size_t, 2> { }; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

The partial specialization of std::tuple_size for pairs provides a compile-time way to obtain the number of elements in a pair, which is always 2, using tuple-like syntax.

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| value[static] | the constant value 2   (public static member constant) |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator std::size_t | converts the object to std::size_t, returns value   (public member function) |
| operator()(C++14) | returns value   (public member function) |

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `value_type` | std::size_t |
| `type` | std::integral_constant<std::size_t, value> |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <tuple>
#include <utility>
 
template<class T>
void test([[maybe_unused]]T t)
{
    [[maybe_unused]]
    int a[std::tuple_size<T>::value]; // can be used at compile time
    std::cout << std::tuple_size<T>::value << '\n'; // or at run time
}
 
int main()
{
    test(std::make_tuple(1, 2, 3.14));
    test(std::make_pair(1, 3.14));
}

```

Output:

```
3
2

```
