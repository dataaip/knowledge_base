| Defined in header `<tuple>` |  |  |
| template< class... Types >  class tuple; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Class template `std::tuple` is a fixed-size collection of heterogeneous values. It is a generalization of std::pair.

If std::is_trivially_destructible<Ti>::value is true for every `Ti` in `Types`, the destructor of `std::tuple` is trivial.

If a program declares an explicit or partial specialization of `std::tuple`, the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Types... | - | the types of the elements that the tuple stores. Empty list is supported. |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a new `tuple`   (public member function) |
| operator= | assigns the contents of one `tuple` to another   (public member function) |
| swap | swaps the contents of two `tuple`s   (public member function) |

### Non-member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| make_tuple(C++11) | creates a `tuple` object of the type defined by the argument types   (function template) |
| tie(C++11) | creates a ****tuple**** of lvalue references or unpacks a tuple into individual objects   (function template) |
| forward_as_tuple(C++11) | creates a `tuple` of forwarding references   (function template) |
| tuple_cat(C++11) | creates a `tuple` by concatenating any number of tuples   (function template) |
| get(std::tuple)(C++11) | tuple accesses specified element   (function template) |
| operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(C++20) | lexicographically compares the values in the tuple   (function template) |
| std::swap(std::tuple)(C++11) | specializes the std::swap algorithm   (function template) |

### Helper concepts

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **tuple-likepair-like**(C++23) | specifies that a type implemented the **tuple protocol** (std::get, std::tuple_element, std::tuple_size) (exposition-only concept\*) |

### Helper classes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::tuple_size<std::tuple>(C++11) | obtains the size of a `tuple`   (class template specialization) |
| std::tuple_element<std::tuple>(C++11) | obtains the type of the specified element   (class template specialization) |
| std::uses_allocator<std::tuple>(C++11) | specializes the std::uses_allocator type trait   (class template specialization) |
| std::basic_common_reference<**tuple-like**>(C++23) | determines the common reference type of a `tuple` and a `tuple-like` type   (class template specialization) |
| std::common_type<**tuple-like**>(C++23) | determines the common type of a `tuple` and a `tuple-like` type   (class template specialization) |
| std::formatter<std::tuple>(C++23) | formatting support for `tuple`   (class template specialization) |
| ignore(C++11) | placeholder to skip an element when unpacking a `tuple` using tie   (constant) |

### Helper specializations

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template< class... Ts >  constexpr bool enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization<std::tuple<Ts...>> = (enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization<Ts> && ...); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

This specialization of std::enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization enables efficient implementation of std::print and std::println for printing a `tuple` object when each element type enables it.

### Deduction guides (since C++17)

### Notes

Since the "shape" of a tuple – its size, the types of its elements, and the ordering of those types – are part of its type signature, they must all be available at compile time and can only depend on other compile-time information. This means that many conditional operations on tuples – in particular, conditional prepend/append and filter – are only possible if the conditions can be evaluated at compile time. For example, given a std::tuple<int, double, int>, it is possible to filter on types – e.g. returning a std::tuple<int, int> – but not to filter on whether or not each element is positive (which would have a different type signature depending on runtime values of the tuple), unless all the elements were themselves constexpr.

As a workaround, one can work with tuples of std::optional, but there is still no way to adjust the size based on runtime information.

Until N4387 (applied as a defect report for C++11), a function could not return a tuple using copy-list-initialization:

```
std::tuple<int, int> foo_tuple()
{
    return {1, -1};  // Error until N4387
    return std::tuple<int, int>{1, -1}; // Always works
    return std::make_tuple(1, -1); // Always works
}

```

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>
#include <tuple>
 
std::tuple<double, char, std::string> get_student(int id)
{
    switch (id)
    {
        case 0: return {3.8, 'A', "Lisa Simpson"};
        case 1: return {2.9, 'C', "Milhouse Van Houten"};
        case 2: return {1.7, 'D', "Ralph Wiggum"};
        case 3: return {0.6, 'F', "Bart Simpson"};
    }
 
    throw std::invalid_argument("id");
}
 
int main()
{
    const auto student0 = get_student(0);
    std::cout << "ID: 0, "
              << "GPA: " << std::get<0>(student0) << ", "
              << "grade: " << std::get<1>(student0) << ", "
              << "name: " << std::get<2>(student0) << '\n';
 
    const auto student1 = get_student(1);
    std::cout << "ID: 1, "
              << "GPA: " << std::get<double>(student1) << ", "
              << "grade: " << std::get<char>(student1) << ", "
              << "name: " << std::get<std::string>(student1) << '\n';
 
    double gpa2;
    char grade2;
    std::string name2;
    std::tie(gpa2, grade2, name2) = get_student(2);
    std::cout << "ID: 2, "
              << "GPA: " << gpa2 << ", "
              << "grade: " << grade2 << ", "
              << "name: " << name2 << '\n';
 
    // C++17 structured binding:
    const auto [gpa3, grade3, name3] = get_student(3);
    std::cout << "ID: 3, "
              << "GPA: " << gpa3 << ", "
              << "grade: " << grade3 << ", "
              << "name: " << name3 << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
ID: 0, GPA: 3.8, grade: A, name: Lisa Simpson
ID: 1, GPA: 2.9, grade: C, name: Milhouse Van Houten
ID: 2, GPA: 1.7, grade: D, name: Ralph Wiggum
ID: 3, GPA: 0.6, grade: F, name: Bart Simpson

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2796 | C++11 | triviality of the destructor of `std::tuple` was unspecified | specified |
| LWG 3990 | C++11 | a program could declare an explicit or partial specialization of `std::tuple` | the program is ill-formed in this case (no diagnostic required) |
