Obtains the components of the stored "broken down" time.

### Return value

Let `d` be the represented duration:

1) true if `d` is negative, false otherwise.2) std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::hours>(abs(d))3) std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::minutes>(abs(d) - hours())4) std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::seconds>(abs(d) - hours() - minutes())5) abs(d) - hours() - minutes() - seconds() if std::chrono::treat_as_floating_point_v<precision::rep> is true; otherwise std::chrono::duration_cast<precision>(abs(d) - hours() - minutes() - seconds()).
