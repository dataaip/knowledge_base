| constexpr year_month( const std::chrono::year& y,                         const std::chrono::month& m ) noexcept; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Constructs a `year_month` object.

1) Default constructor leaves the year and month uninitialized.2) Constructs a `year_month` object storing the year y and the month m.

### Notes

A more convenient way to construct a `year_month` is with operator/, e.g., 2007y/std::chrono::April.
