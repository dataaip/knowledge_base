Increments or decrements the number of ticks for this duration.

If `rep_` is a member variable holding the number of ticks in a duration object,

1) Equivalent to ++rep_; return \*this;.2) Equivalent to return duration(rep_++).3) Equivalent to --rep_; return \*this;.4) Equivalent to return duration(rep_--);.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1,3) A reference to this duration after modification.2,4) A copy of the duration made before modification.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::chrono::hours h(1);
    std::chrono::minutes m = ++h;
    m--;
    std::cout << m.count() << " minutes\n";
}

```

Output:

```
119 minutes

```
