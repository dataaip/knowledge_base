| static std::time_t to_time_t( const time_point& t ) noexcept; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Converts t to a std::time_t type.

If std::time_t has lower precision, it is implementation-defined whether the value is rounded or truncated.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| t | - | system clock time point to convert |

### Return value

A std::time_t value representing t.

### Example

Get the current time as a std::time_t two ways.

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
int main()
{
    // The old way
    std::time_t oldt = std::time({});
 
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(2700ms);
 
    // The new way
    auto const now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
    std::time_t newt = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(now);
 
    std::cout << "newt - oldt == " << newt - oldt << " s\n";
}

```

Possible output:

```
newt - oldt == 3 s

```
