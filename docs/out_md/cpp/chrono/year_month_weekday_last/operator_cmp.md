| constexpr bool operator==( const std::chrono::year_month_weekday_last& x,                              const std::chrono::year_month_weekday_last& y ) noexcept; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Compares the two `year_month_weekday_last` values x and y.

The `!=` operator is synthesized from `operator==`.

### Return value

x.year() == y.year() && x.month() == y.month() && x.weekday() == y.weekday()

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std::chrono;
 
int main()
{
    constexpr auto ymwdl1{Tuesday[last]/11/2021};
    auto ymwdl2 = Tuesday[last]/11/2020;
    ymwdl2 += months(12);
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << (ymwdl1 == ymwdl2) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
true

```
