| time_point& operator+=( const duration& d ); | (1) | (since C++11)  (constexpr since C++17) |
| time_point& operator-=( const duration& d ); | (2) | (since C++11)  (constexpr since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Modifies the time point by the given duration.

1) Applies the offset d to `pt`. Effectively, d is added to the internally stored duration `d_` as d_ += d.2) Applies the offset d to `pt` in negative direction. Effectively, d is subtracted from internally stored duration `d_` as d_ -= d.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d | - | a time offset to apply |

### Return value

\*this

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
