| timespec(C++17) | | | | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<ctime>` |  |  |
| int timespec_get( std::timespec\* ts, int base ); | (1) | (since C++17) |
| #define TIME_UTC /\* implementation-defined \*/ | (2) | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

1) Modifies the std::timespec object pointed to by ts to hold the current calendar time in the time base base.2) Expands to a value suitable for use as the base argument of `std::timespec_get`.

Other macro constants beginning with `TIME_` may be provided by the implementation to indicate additional time bases.

If base is `TIME_UTC`, then

- ts->tv_sec is set to the number of seconds since an implementation defined epoch, truncated to a whole value,
- ts->tv_nsec member is set to the integral number of nanoseconds, rounded to the resolution of the system clock.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ts | - | pointer to an object of type std::timespec |
| base | - | `TIME_UTC` or another nonzero integer value indicating the time base |

### Return value

The value of base if successful, zero otherwise.

### Notes

The POSIX function `clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, ts)` may also be used to populate a `std::timespec` with the time since the Epoch.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::timespec ts;
    std::timespec_get(&ts, TIME_UTC);
    char buf[100];
    std::strftime(buf, sizeof buf, "%D %T", std::gmtime(&ts.tv_sec));
    std::cout << "Current time: " << buf << '.' << ts.tv_nsec << " UTC\n";
}

```

Possible output:

```
Current time: 06/24/16 20:07:42.949494132 UTC

```
