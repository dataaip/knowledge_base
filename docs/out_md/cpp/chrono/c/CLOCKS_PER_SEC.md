| Defined in header `<ctime>` |  |  |
| #define CLOCKS_PER_SEC /\* implementation-defined \*/ |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Expands to an expression (not necessarily a compile-time constant) of type std::clock_t equal to the number of clock ticks per second, as returned by std::clock().

### Notes

POSIX defines CLOCKS_PER_SEC as 1'000'000, regardless of the actual precision of std::clock().

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
    const std::clock_t cps{CLOCKS_PER_SEC};
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
    std::cout << cps << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
1,000,000

```
