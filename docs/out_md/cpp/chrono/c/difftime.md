| Defined in header `<ctime>` |  |  |
| double difftime( std::time_t time_end, std::time_t time_beg ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Computes difference between two calendar times as std::time_t objects (time_end - time_beg) in seconds. If time_end refers to time point before time_beg then the result is negative.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| time_beg, time_end | - | times to compare |

### Return value

Difference between two times in seconds.

### Notes

On POSIX systems, std::time_t is measured in seconds, and `difftime` is equivalent to arithmetic subtraction, but C and C++ allow fractional units for `time_t`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::time_t start = std::time(nullptr);
    volatile double d = 1.0;
 
    // some time-consuming operation
    for (int p = 0; p < 10000; ++p)
        for (int q = 0; q < 100000; ++q)
            d = d + p * d * q + d;
 
    std::cout << "Wall time passed: "
              << std::difftime(std::time(nullptr), start) << " s.\n";
}

```

Possible output:

```
Wall time passed: 9 s.

```
