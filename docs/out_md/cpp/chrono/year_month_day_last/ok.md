Checks if \*this represents a valid date. Because a `year_month_day_last` represents the last day of a particular month, it represents a valid date as long as the year and month are valid.

### Return value

year().ok() && month().ok()

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <chrono>
 
int main()
{
    auto ymdl{std::chrono::last/11/2020};
    assert(ymdl.ok());
    ymdl = std::chrono::year(2020)/std::chrono::month(13)/std::chrono::last;
    assert(not ymdl.ok());
}

```
