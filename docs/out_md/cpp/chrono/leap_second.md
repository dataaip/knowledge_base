| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| class leap_second; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The class `leap_second` represents the date and time of a leap second insertion.

Users cannot construct `leap_second` objects except by copying from existing `leap_second` objects. The library implementation creates `leap_second` objects when it initializes the time zone database and provides const access to these objects.

`leap_second` has a defaulted copy constructor and a defaulted copy assignment operator.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| date | obtains the time of leap second insertion   (public member function) |

### Nonmember functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator==operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>(C++20) | compares two `leap_second` values or a `leap_second` value and a sys_time   (function template) |

### Helper classes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::hash<std::chrono::leap_second>(C++26) | hash support for ****std::chrono::leap_second****   (class template specialization) |
