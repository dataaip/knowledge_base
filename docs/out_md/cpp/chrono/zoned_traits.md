| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| template < class TimeZonePtr >  struct zoned_traits { }; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| template <>  struct zoned_traits<const std::chrono::time_zone\*>; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The class `zoned_traits` provides a way to customize the behavior of the constructors of std::chrono::zoned_time with custom time zone pointer types. In particular, it allows such types to specify the default time zone to use and the mapping of a time zone's name to the corresponding time zone pointer. It is acceptable for custom time zone pointer types to not support either operation, in which case the corresponding constructors of `zoned_time` will not participate in overload resolution.

The primary template is empty. A specialization is provided for const std::chrono::time_zone\*, the default time zone pointer type.

### Member functions

## std::chrono::zoned_traits<const std::chrono::time_zone\*>::default_zone

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| static const std::chrono::time_zone\* default_zone(); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns a time zone pointer for the default time zone (UTC).

### Return value

std::chrono::locate_zone("UTC").

## std::chrono::zoned_traits<const std::chrono::time_zone\*>::locate_zone

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| static const std::chrono::time_zone\* locate_zone(std::string_view name); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns the time zone pointer for the time zone designated by `name`.

### Return value

std::chrono::locate_zone(name).
