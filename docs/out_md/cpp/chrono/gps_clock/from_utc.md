| template< class Duration >  static std::chrono::gps_time<std::common_type_t<Duration, std::chrono::seconds>>     from_utc( const std::chrono::utc_time<Duration>& ) noexcept; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Converts the `utc_time` t to a `gps_time` representing the same point in time.

### Return value

A std::chrono::gps_time representing the same point in time as t, computed as if by constructing a value of the return type from t.time_since_epoch() and subtracting 315964809s (315964809 is the number of seconds between the epochs of the two clocks: 1980-01-06 00:00:00 UTC for `gps_clock` and 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC for `utc_clock`).
