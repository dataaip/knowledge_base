| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| class year_month; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The class `year_month` represents a specific month of a specific year, but with an unspecified day. It is a field-based time point, with a resolution of std::chrono::months.

`year_month` is a TriviallyCopyable StandardLayoutType.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a `year_month`   (public member function) |
| yearmonth | accesses the stored year and month   (public member function) |
| operator+=operator-= | modifies the `year_month` by some number of months or years   (public member function) |
| ok | checks if this `year_month` is valid   (public member function) |

### Nonmember functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator==operator<=>(C++20) | compares two `year_month` values   (function) |
| operator+operator-(C++20) | performs arithmetic on `year_month`   (function) |
| operator<<(C++20) | outputs a `year_month` into a stream   (function template) |
| from_stream(C++20) | parses a `year_month` from a stream according to the provided format   (function template) |

### Helper classes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::formatter<std::chrono::year_month>(C++20) | formatting support for `year_month`   (class template specialization) |
| std::hash<std::chrono::year_month>(C++26) | hash support for ****std::chrono::year_month****   (class template specialization) |
