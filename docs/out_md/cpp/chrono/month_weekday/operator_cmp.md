| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| constexpr bool operator==( const std::chrono::month_weekday& x,                             const std::chrono::month_weekday& y ) noexcept; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Compares the two `month_weekday` values x and y.

The `!=` operator is synthesized from `operator==`.

### Return value

x.month() == y.month() && x.weekday_indexed() == y.weekday_indexed()

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr auto mwdi1{std::chrono::March/std::chrono::Friday[1]};
 
    constexpr auto mwdi2
    {
        std::chrono::month_weekday
        {
            std::chrono::month(3), std::chrono::weekday(5)[1]
        }
    };
 
    static_assert(mwdi1 == mwdi2);
}

```
