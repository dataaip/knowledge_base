| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| template< class CharT, class Traits, class Duration >  std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&      operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os, const std::chrono::file_time<Duration>& tp ); |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Outputs tp into the stream os, as if by os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY-WIDEN("{:L%F %T}"), tp), where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L%F %T}") is "{:L%F %T}" if `CharT` is char, and L"{:L%F %T}" if `CharT` is wchar_t.

### Return value

os

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P2372R3 | C++20 | the given locale was used by default | `L` is needed to use the given locale |
