| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| struct leap_second_info {  bool is_leap_second;      std::chrono::seconds elapsed; }; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

A `leap_second_info` indicates whether a UTC time is during a positive leap second insertion and the total number of leap seconds between 1 January 1970 and the UTC time.

`leap_second_info` has no base classes or members other than is_leap_second, elapsed, and implicitly declared special member functions.

### Member objects

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| is_leap_second | whether the UTC time is during a positive leap second insertion   (public member object) |
| elapsed | the sum of leap seconds between 1 January 1970 and the UTC time   (public member object) |

### Notes

`leap_second_info` is typically obtained from std::chrono::get_leap_second_info.

| leap_second(C++20) | contains information about a leap second insertion   (class) |
