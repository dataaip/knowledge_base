|  |  |  |

Converts a `sys_time` t to a `utc_time` `u` that represents the same point in time.

u.time_since_epoch() - t.time_since_epoch() is equal to the number of leap seconds that was inserted between t and 1 January 1970. If t is the exact date of a leap second insertion, that leap second is counted as inserted.

### Return value

A `utc_time` representing the same point in time as t.
