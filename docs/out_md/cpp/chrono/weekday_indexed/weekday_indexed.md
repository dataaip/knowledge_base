| weekday_indexed() = default; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| constexpr weekday_indexed( const std::chrono::weekday& wd, unsigned index ) noexcept; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Constructs a `weekday_indexed`.

1) Default constructor leaves both the std::chrono::weekday and the index value uninitialized.2) Constructs a weekday_indexed storing the weekday wd and the index index. The values held are unspecified if !wd.ok() || index > 7.

### Notes

A more convenient way to construct a weekday_indexed is with weekday's operator[], i.e., wd[index].

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std::chrono;
 
int main()
{
    constexpr auto third_friday = weekday_indexed(Friday, 3); // uses constructor (2)
    static_assert(third_friday == Friday[3]);
 
    weekday_indexed wdi = Tuesday[2]; // represents the 2nd Tuesday
    std::cout << year_month_day{ wdi / October / 2019y } << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
2019-10-08

```
