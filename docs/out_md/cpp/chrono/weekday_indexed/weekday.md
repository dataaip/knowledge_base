Retrieves a copy of the std::chrono::weekday object stored in \*this.

### Return value

A copy of the std::chrono::weekday object stored in \*this.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
 
    // 2nd Tuesday of a month
    std::chrono::weekday_indexed wdi{std::chrono::Tuesday[2]};
    std::cout << (std::chrono::year_month_day{wdi/10/2019} == 
                  std::chrono::year_month_day{std::chrono::October/8/2019}) << ' ';
 
    // 2nd Tuesday => 2nd Thursday
    wdi = {wdi.weekday() + std::chrono::days(2), wdi.index()};
    std::cout << (std::chrono::year_month_day{wdi/10/2019} == 
                  std::chrono::year_month_day{std::chrono::October/10/2019}) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
true true

```
