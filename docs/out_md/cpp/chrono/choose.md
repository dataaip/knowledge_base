| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| enum class choose {      earliest,      latest }; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The scoped enumeration `choose` can be passed to certain member functions of std::chrono::time_zone and std::chrono::zoned_time to control how ambiguous or nonexistent local times should be resolved. Passing `choose::earliest` causes the earlier time point to be returned, while passing `choose::latest` causes the later time point to be returned. (For nonexistent local times, these two time points are identical.)

If a `choose` is not passed and an ambiguous or nonexistent local time is encountered, a std::chrono::ambiguous_local_time or std::chrono::nonexistent_local_time exception (as applicable) will be thrown.
