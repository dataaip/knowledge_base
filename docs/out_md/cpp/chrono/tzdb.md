****std::chrono::tzdb****

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Member functions | | | | |
| tzdb::locate_zone | | | | |
| tzdb::current_zone | | | | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| struct tzdb; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The class `tzdb` represents a copy of the IANA time zone database. Users cannot construct a `tzdb` and can only obtain read-only access to one via the free functions std::chrono::get_tzdb_list and std::chrono::get_tzdb.

### Member objects

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member object | Description |
| `version` | A std::string that contains the version of the database |
| `zones` | A sorted std::vector<std::chrono::time_zone> containing description of time zones |
| `links` | A sorted std::vector<std::chrono::time_zone_link> containing description of alternative names of time zones (links) |
| `leap_seconds` | A sorted std::vector<std::chrono::leap_second> containing description of leap seconds |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| locate_zone | locate a time zone with the given name   (public member function) |
| current_zone | return the local time zone   (public member function) |
