| year() = default; | (1) | (since C++20) |
| constexpr explicit year( int y ) noexcept; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Constructs a `year` object.

1) Default constructor leaves the year value uninitialized.2) If y is in the range `[`-32767`,`32767`]`, constructs a `year` object holding the year value y. Otherwise the value held is unspecified.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    using namespace std::chrono;
 
    constexpr int leap_years = []
    {
        int count{};
        for (int i{year::min()}; i <= int{year::max()}; ++i)
            if (year{i}.is_leap()) // uses constructor (2)
                ++count;
        return count;
    } ();
 
    static_assert(15891 == leap_years);
 
    std::cout << "There are " << leap_years << " leap years in the range ["
              << int(year::min()) << ", " << int(year::max()) << "].\n";
}

```

Output:

```
There are 15891 leap years in the range [-32767, 32767].
