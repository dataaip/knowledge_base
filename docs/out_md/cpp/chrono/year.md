| class year; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The class `year` represents a year in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. Its range is `[`-32767`,`32767`]`.

`year` is a TriviallyCopyable StandardLayoutType.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a `year`   (public member function) |
| operator++operator++(int)operator--operator--(int) | increments or decrements the year   (public member function) |
| operator+=operator-= | adds or subtracts a number of years from a `year`   (public member function) |
| operator+operator- | applies unary operators to `year`   (public member function) |
| is_leap | determines if the year is a leap year   (public member function) |
| operator int | retrieve the year value   (public member function) |
| ok | checks if the stored year value is valid   (public member function) |
| min[static] | returns the smallest possible year value   (public static member function) |
| max[static] | returns the largest possible `year`   (public static member function) |

### Non-member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator==operator<=>(C++20) | compares two `year` values   (function) |
| operator+operator-(C++20) | performs arithmetic on `year`s   (function) |
| operator<<(C++20) | outputs a `year` into a stream   (function template) |
| from_stream(C++20) | parses a `year` from a stream according to the provided format   (function template) |

### Helper classes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::formatter<std::chrono::year>(C++20) | formatting support for `year`   (class template specialization) |
| std::hash<std::chrono::year>(C++26) | hash support for ****std::chrono::year****   (class template specialization) |

### Literals

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in inline namespace `std::literals::chrono_literals` | |
| operator""y(C++20) | a std::chrono::year literal representing a particular year   (function) |
