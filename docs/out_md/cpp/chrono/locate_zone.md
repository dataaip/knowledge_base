| Defined in header `<chrono>` |  |  |
| const std::chrono::time_zone\* locate_zone( std::string_view tz_name ); |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Convenience function for locating a time zone in the time zone database. Equivalent to std::chrono::get_tzdb().locate_zone(tz_name).

### Exceptions

std::runtime_error if the specified time zone cannot be found, or if this is the first reference to the time zone database and the time zone database cannot be initialized.

### Notes

A call to this function that is the first reference to the time zone database will cause it to be initialized.
