Retrieves the field values stored in this `year_month_weekday` object.

### Return value

1) Returns the stored std::chrono::year value.2) Returns the stored std::chrono::month value.3) Returns the stored std::chrono::weekday value.4) Returns the stored weekday index.5) weekday()[index()]

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <chrono>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr auto ym{std::chrono::year(2021)/std::chrono::January};
    constexpr auto wdi{std::chrono::Wednesday[1]};
    auto ymwdi{ym/wdi};
    const auto index{ymwdi.index() + 1};
    auto weekday{ymwdi.weekday() + std::chrono::days(1)};
    ymwdi = {ymwdi.year()/ymwdi.month()/weekday[index]};
    // Second Thursday in January, 2021
    assert(std::chrono::year_month_day{ymwdi} == std::chrono::January/14/2021);
}
