Enumeration constants of type `std::float_round_style` indicate the rounding style used by floating-point arithmetic whenever a result of an expression is stored in an object of a floating-point type. The values are:

### Enumeration constants

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Definition |
| ****std::round_indeterminate**** | Rounding style cannot be determined |
| ****std::round_toward_zero**** | Rounding toward zero |
| ****std::round_to_nearest**** | Rounding toward nearest representable value |
| ****std::round_toward_infinity**** | Rounding toward positive infinity |
| ****std::round_toward_neg_infinity**** | Rounding toward negative infinity |
