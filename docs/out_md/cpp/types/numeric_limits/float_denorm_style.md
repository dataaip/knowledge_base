| enum float_denorm_style {      denorm_indeterminate = -1,      denorm_absent        = 0,      denorm_present       = 1 }; |  | (deprecated in C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Enumeration constants of type ****std::float_denorm_style**** indicate support of subnormal values by floating-point types.

### Enumeration constants

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Definition |
| ****std::denorm_indeterminate**** | Support of subnormal values cannot be determined |
| ****std::denorm_absent**** | The type does not support subnormal values |
| ****std::denorm_present**** | The type allows subnormal values |
