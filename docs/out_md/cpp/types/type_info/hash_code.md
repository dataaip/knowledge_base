| std::size_t hash_code() const noexcept; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Returns an unspecified value (here denoted by **hash code**) such that for all std::type_info objects referring to the same type, their **hash code** is the same.

No other guarantees are given: std::type_info objects referring to different types may have the same **hash code** (although the standard recommends that implementations avoid this as much as possible), and **hash code** for the same type can change between invocations of the same program.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A value that is identical for all std::type_info objects referring to the same type.

### Example

The following program is an example of an efficient type-value mapping without using std::type_index.

Run this code

```
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <typeinfo>
#include <unordered_map>
 
struct A
{
    virtual ~A() {}
};
 
struct B : A {};
struct C : A {};
 
using TypeInfoRef = std::reference_wrapper<const std::type_info>;
 
struct Hasher
{
    std::size_t operator()(TypeInfoRef code) const
    {
        return code.get().hash_code();
    }
};
 
struct EqualTo
{
    bool operator()(TypeInfoRef lhs, TypeInfoRef rhs) const
    {
        return lhs.get() == rhs.get();
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::unordered_map<TypeInfoRef, std::string, Hasher, EqualTo> type_names;
 
    type_names[typeid(int)] = "int";
    type_names[typeid(double)] = "double";
    type_names[typeid(A)] = "A";
    type_names[typeid(B)] = "B";
    type_names[typeid(C)] = "C";
 
    int i;
    double d;
    A a;
 
    // note that we're storing pointer to type A
    std::unique_ptr<A> b(new B);
    std::unique_ptr<A> c(new C);
 
    std::cout << "i is " << type_names[typeid(i)] << '\n';
    std::cout << "d is " << type_names[typeid(d)] << '\n';
    std::cout << "a is " << type_names[typeid(a)] << '\n';
    std::cout << "*b is " << type_names[typeid(*b)] << '\n';
    std::cout << "*c is " << type_names[typeid(*c)] << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
i is int
d is double
a is A
*b is B
*c is C

```
