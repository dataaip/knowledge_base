Returns an iterator to the first element of the `adjacent_transform_view`.

Let `inner_` be the underlying ranges::adjacent_view.

1) Equivalent to return /\*iterator\*/<false>(\*this, inner_.begin());.2) Equivalent to return /\*iterator\*/<true>(\*this, inner_.begin());.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Iterator to the first element.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
    auto sum = [](auto... args) { return (... + args); };
 
    constexpr auto view = std::views::iota(13, 1337)
                        | std::views::adjacent_transform<3>(sum);
 
    static_assert(*view.begin() == 42 and 42 == 13 + 14 + 15);
}

```
