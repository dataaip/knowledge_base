1) Used to obtain the iterator type of the type `T`.2) Used to obtain the constant iterator type of the `range` type `R`.3) Used to obtain the sentinel type of the range type `R`.4) Used to obtain the constant sentinel type of the range type `R`.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T | - | a type that can be used in std::ranges::begin |
| R | - | a `range` type or a `sized_range` type |

### Notes

`iterator_t` can be applied to non-range types, e.g. arrays with unknown bound.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3946 | C++23 | `const_iterator_t` and `const_sentinel_t` were inconsistent with the result of `ranges::cbegin` and `ranges::cend` respectively | tweaked |
