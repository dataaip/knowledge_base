|  |  |  |

The default implementation of `cbegin()` member function returns a constant beginning iterator of the range.

1) Let derived be a reference bound to static_cast<D&>(\*this). Equivalent to return ranges::cbegin(derived);.2) Same as (1), except that derived is static_cast<const D&>(\*this).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A constant beginning iterator of the range.

### Notes

All range adaptors and range factories in the standard library and std::ranges::subrange use the default implementation of `cbegin`.
