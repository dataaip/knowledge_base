1) A range adaptor that represents `view` of an underlying sequence after applying a transformation function to each element.2) RangeAdaptorObject. The expression views::transform(e, f) is expression-equivalent to transform_view(e, f) for any suitable subexpressions e and f.

`transform_view` models the concepts `random_access_range`, `bidirectional_range`, `forward_range`, `input_range`, `common_range`, and `sized_range` when the underlying view `V` models respective concepts.

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member name | Definition |
| `base_` (private) | the underlying `view` of type `V` (exposition-only member object\*) |
| `fun_` (private) | the underlying function object of type `copyable-box``<F>`(until C++23)`movable-box``<F>`(since C++23) (exposition-only member object\*) |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a `transform_view`   (public member function) |
| base | returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view   (public member function) |
| begin | returns an iterator to the beginning   (public member function) |
| end | returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end   (public member function) |
| size | returns the number of elements. Provided only if the underlying (adapted) range satisfies `sized_range`.   (public member function) |
| Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface | |
| empty | returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies `sized_range` or `forward_range`.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| cbegin(C++23) | returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| cend(C++23) | returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| operator bool | returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| front | returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies `forward_range`.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| back | returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies `bidirectional_range` and `common_range`.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| [operator[]](view_interface/operator_at.html "cpp/ranges/view interface/operator at") | returns the `n`th element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies `random_access_range`.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |

### Deduction guides

### Nested classes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **iterator** | the iterator type (exposition-only member class template\*) |
| **sentinel** | the sentinel type (exposition-only member class template\*) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iterator>
#include <ranges>
#include <string>
 
char rot13a(const char x, const char a)
{
    return a + (x - a + 13) % 26;
}
 
char rot13(const char x)
{
    if ('Z' >= x and x >= 'A')
        return rot13a(x, 'A');
 
    if ('z' >= x and x >= 'a')
        return rot13a(x, 'a');
 
    return x;
}
 
int main()
{
    auto show = [](const unsigned char x) { std::putchar(x); };
 
    std::string in{"cppreference.com\n"};
    std::ranges::for_each(in, show);
    std::ranges::for_each(in | std::views::transform(rot13), show);
 
    std::string out;
    std::ranges::copy(std::views::transform(in, rot13), std::back_inserter(out));
    std::ranges::for_each(out, show);
    std::ranges::for_each(out | std::views::transform(rot13), show);
}

```

Output:
