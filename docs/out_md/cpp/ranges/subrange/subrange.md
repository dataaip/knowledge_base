Constructs a `subrange`.

For the definitions of /\*make-unsigned-like-t\*/ and /\*different-from\*/, see `make-unsigned-like-t` and `different-from` respectively.

| Overload | Data members | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `begin_` | `end_` | `size_` (only if `StoreSize` is true) |
| (1) | value-initialized | value-initialized | initialized with ​0​ |
| (2) | initialized with std::move(i) | initialized with s | N/A |
| (3) | initialized with n |
| (4) | initialized with std::move(ranges::begin(r)) | initialized with ranges::end(r) | initialized with static_cast<decltype(`size_` ﻿)> (ranges::size(r)) |
| (5) | initialized with n |

2) If ``i`,`s`)` is not a [valid range, the behavior is undefined.3) If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

- ``i`,`s`)` is not a valid range.
- n ==`to-unsigned-like` ﻿([ranges::distance(i, s)) is false.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| i | - | iterator that denotes the beginning of the range |
| s | - | sentinel that denotes the end of the range |
| r | - | range |
| n | - | size hint, must be equal to the size of the range |

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P2393R1 | C++20 | for overload (4), `size_` might be initialized with ranges::size(r), but it is not always implicitly convertible to the corresponding **unsigned-integer-like** type | made the conversion explicit |
