| constexpr auto begin() const requires ranges::range<const V>; | (2) | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Returns an iterator to the first element of the `take_view`.

1) Returns a std::counted_iterator or a ranges::iterator_t<V>.2) Returns a std::counted_iterator or a ranges::iterator_t<const V>.

Overload (1) does not participate in overload resolution if `V` is a simple view (that is, if `V` and `const V` are views with the same iterator and sentinel types).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The result depends on the concepts satisfied by possibly const-qualified underlying view type `Base`, which is `V` for (1) or `const V` for (2).

Let `base_` be the underlying view, `count_` be the underlying counter (equals to ​0​ if `take_view` was default initialized).

| The underlying view type satisfies ... | | `random_access_range` | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| yes | no |
| `sized_range` | yes | ranges::begin(base_) | std::counted_iterator(ranges::begin(base_),     ranges::range_difference_t<Base_>(this->size())) |
| no | std::counted_iterator(ranges::begin(base_), count_) | |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <concepts>
#include <forward_list>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
#include <type_traits>
using namespace std::literals;
 
int main()
{
    {
        static constexpr auto v = {"∀x"sv, "∃y"sv, "ε"sv, "δ"sv};
        auto view = std::ranges::take_view(v, 8);
        auto iter = view.begin();
        std::cout << *iter << '\n';
        static_assert(
            std::ranges::sized_range<decltype(v)> and
            std::ranges::random_access_range<decltype(v)> and
            std::is_same_v<decltype(iter), decltype(std::ranges::begin(v))>
        );
    }
 
    {
        std::forward_list v = {"Ax"sv, "Ey"sv, "p"sv, "q"sv};
        auto view = std::ranges::take_view(v, 8);
        auto iter = view.begin();
        std::cout << *iter << '\n';
        static_assert(
            not std::ranges::sized_range<decltype(v)> and
            not std::ranges::random_access_range<decltype(v)> and
            std::is_same_v<decltype(iter),
                std::counted_iterator<
                    std::forward_list<std::string_view>::iterator>>
        );
    }
}

```

Output:

```
∀x
Ax

```
