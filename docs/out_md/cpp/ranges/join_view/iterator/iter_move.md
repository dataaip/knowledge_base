| friend constexpr decltype(auto) iter_move( const /\*iterator\*/& i )      noexcept( /\*see below\*/ ); |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Casts the result of dereferencing the underlying iterator i.`inner_` to its associated rvalue reference type.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when `join_view::iterator<Const>` is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| i | - | iterator |

### Return value

Equivalent to: ranges::iter_move(i.inner_).

### Exceptions

noexcept specification:noexcept(noexcept(ranges::iter_move(i.inner_)))
