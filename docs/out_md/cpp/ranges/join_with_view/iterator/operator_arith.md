Increments or decrements the iterator.

1) Increments the inner iterator as if by std::visit([](auto& it){ ++it; },`inner_it_` ﻿);. After that, adjusts the inner and outer iterators as follows:

- If the incremented inner iterator is the past-the-end iterator of the pattern range, it is set to an iterator to the beginning of the next inner range.
- If the incremented inner iterator is the past-the-end iterator of an inner range, the outer iterator is incremented. Then:

:   - If the incremented outer iterator is not the past-the-end iterator of the outer range, the inner iterator is set to an iterator to the beginning of the pattern range.
    - Otherwise, if std::is_reference_v<`InnerBase` ﻿﻿> is true, the inner iterator is set to a pattern iterator holding a singular value.

- Repeats the operations above until either the inner iterator is not a past-the-end iterator, or the outer iterator is a past-the-end iterator.
2) Equivalent to ++\*this;.3) Equivalent to auto tmp = \*this;  
++\*this;  
return tmp;.4) If the outer iterator is the past-the-end iterator of the outer range, decrements it and sets the inner iterator to the past-the-end iterator of the last inner range, otherwise do nothing. After that, adjusts the inner and outer iterators as follows:

- If the inner iterator refers to the beginning of an inner range, it is set to the past-the-end iterator of the pattern range.
- If the inner iterator refers to the beginning of the pattern range, the outer iterator is decremented, and the inner iterator is set to the past-the-end iterator of the previous inner range.
- Repeats the operations above until the inner iterator does not refer to the beginning of any range.
 Finally, decrements the inner iterator as if by std::visit([](auto& it){ --it; },`inner_it_` ﻿);.5) Equivalent to auto tmp = \*this;  
--\*this;  
return tmp;.
