1) A range adaptor that represents `view` of the elements from an underlying sequence, starting at the beginning and ending at the first element for which the predicate returns false.2) RangeAdaptorObject. The expression views::take_while(e, f) is expression-equivalent to take_while_view(e, f) for any suitable subexpressions e and f.

`take_while_view` models the concepts `contiguous_range`, `random_access_range`, `bidirectional_range`, `forward_range`, and `input_range` when the underlying view `V` models respective concepts.

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member name | Definition |
| `base_` (private) | the underlying `view` of type `V` (exposition-only member object\*) |
| `pred_` (private) | the underlying function object of type `copyable-box``<Pred>`(until C++23)`movable-box``<Pred>`(since C++23) (exposition-only member object\*) |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a `take_while_view`   (public member function) |
| base | returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view   (public member function) |
| pred | returns a reference to the stored predicate   (public member function) |
| begin | returns an iterator to the beginning   (public member function) |
| end | returns a sentinel representing the end   (public member function) |
| Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface | |
| empty | returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies `sized_range` or `forward_range`.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| cbegin(C++23) | returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| cend(C++23) | returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| operator bool | returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| data | gets the address of derived view's data. Provided if its iterator type satisfies `contiguous_iterator`.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| front | returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies `forward_range`.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |
| [operator[]](view_interface/operator_at.html "cpp/ranges/view interface/operator at") | returns the `n`th element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies `random_access_range`.   (public member function of `std::ranges::view_interface<D>`) |

### Deduction guides

### Nested classes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **sentinel** | the sentinel type (exposition-only member class template\*) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
    for (int year : std::views::iota(2020)
                  | std::views::take_while([](int y){ return y < 2026; }))
        std::cout << year << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    const char note[]{"Today is yesterday's tomorrow!..."};
    auto not_dot = [](char c){ return c != '.'; };
    for (char x : std::ranges::take_while_view(note, not_dot))
        std::cout << x;
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025
Today is yesterday's tomorrow!

```
