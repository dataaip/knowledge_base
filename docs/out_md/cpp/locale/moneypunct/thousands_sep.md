| public:  char_type thousands_sep() const; | (1) |  |
| protected:  virtual char_type do_thousands_sep() const; | (2) |  |
|  |  |  |

1) Public member function, calls the member function `do_thousands_sep` of the most derived class.2) Returns the character to be used as the separator between digit groups when parsing or formatting the integral parts of monetary values.

### Return value

The object of type `char_type` to use as the thousands separator. In common U.S. locales, this is ',' or L','.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>
 
struct space_out : std::moneypunct<char>
{
    pattern do_pos_format() const { return {value, none, none, none}; }
    int do_frac_digits() const { return 0; }
    char_type do_thousands_sep() const { return ' '; }
    string_type do_grouping() const { return "\002"; }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
    std::cout << "american locale: " << std::showbase
              << std::put_money(12345678.0) << '\n';
 
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale(std::cout.getloc(), new space_out));
    std::cout << "locale with modified moneypunct: "
              << std::put_money(12345678.0) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
american locale: $123,456.78
locale with modified moneypunct: 12 34 56 78

```
