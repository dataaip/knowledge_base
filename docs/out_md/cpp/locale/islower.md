| Defined in header `<locale>` |  |  |
| template< class CharT >  bool islower( CharT ch, const locale& loc ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Checks if the given character is classified as a lowercase alphabetic character by the given locale's std::ctype facet.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ch | - | character |
| loc | - | locale |

### Return value

Returns true if the character is classified as lowercase, false otherwise.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class CharT> bool islower(CharT ch, const std::locale& loc) {     return std::use_facet<std::ctype<CharT>>(loc).is(std::ctype_base::lower, ch); } ``` |

### Example

Demonstrates the use of `islower()` with different locales (OS-specific).

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
    const wchar_t c = L'\u03c0'; // GREEK SMALL LETTER PI
 
    std::locale loc1("C");
    std::cout << std::boolalpha
              << "islower('π', C locale) returned "
              << std::islower(c, loc1) << '\n'
              << "isupper('π', C locale) returned "
              << std::isupper(c, loc1) << '\n';
 
    std::locale loc2("en_US.UTF8");
    std::cout << "islower('π', Unicode locale) returned "
              << std::islower(c, loc2) << '\n'
              << "isupper('π', Unicode locale) returned "
              << std::isupper(c, loc2) << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
islower('π', C locale) returned false
isupper('π', C locale) returned false
islower('π', Unicode locale) returned true
isupper('π', Unicode locale) returned false

```
