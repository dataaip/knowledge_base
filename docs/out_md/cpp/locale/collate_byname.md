`std::collate_byname` is a std::collate facet which encapsulates locale-specific collation (comparison) and hashing of strings. Just like std::collate, it can be imbued in std::regex and applied, by means of std::locale::operator()"), directly to all standard algorithms that expect a string comparison predicate.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<locale>` | |
| std::collate_byname<char> | locale-specific collation of multibyte strings |
| std::collate_byname<wchar_t> | locale-specific collation of wide strings |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ****(constructor)**** | constructs a new `collate_byname` facet   (public member function) |
| ****(destructor)**** | destroys a `collate_byname` facet   (protected member function) |

## std::collate_byname::collate_byname

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| explicit collate_byname( const char\* name, std::size_t refs = 0 ); |  |  |
| explicit collate_byname( const std::string& name, std::size_t refs = 0 ); |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Constructs a new `std::collate_byname` facet for a locale with name.

refs is used for resource management: if refs == 0, the implementation destroys the facet, when the last std::locale object holding it is destroyed. Otherwise, the object is not destroyed.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | - | the name of the locale |
| refs | - | the number of references that link to the facet |

## std::collate_byname::~collate_byname

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| protected:  ~collate_byname(); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Destroys the facet.

## Inherited from std::collate

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `char_type` | `CharT` |
| `string_type` | std::basic_string<CharT> |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member | Description |
| std::locale::id `id` [static] | the identifier of the facet |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| compare | invokes `do_compare`   (public member function of `std::collate<CharT>`) |
| transform | invokes `do_transform`   (public member function of `std::collate<CharT>`) |
| hash | invokes `do_hash`   (public member function of `std::collate<CharT>`) |

### Protected member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| do_compare[virtual] | compares two strings using this facet's collation rules   (virtual protected member function of `std::collate<CharT>`) |
| do_transform[virtual] | transforms a string so that collation can be replaced by comparison   (virtual protected member function of `std::collate<CharT>`) |
| do_hash[virtual] | generates an integer hash value using this facet's collation rules   (virtual protected member function of `std::collate<CharT>`) |

### Notes

Collation order is the dictionary order: the position of the letter in the national alphabet (its **equivalence class**) has higher priority than its case or variant. Within an equivalence class, lowercase characters collate before their uppercase equivalents and locale-specific order may apply to the characters with diacritics. In some locales, groups of characters compare as single **collation units**. For example, "ch" in Czech follows "h" and precedes "i", and "dzs" in Hungarian follows "dz" and precedes "g".
