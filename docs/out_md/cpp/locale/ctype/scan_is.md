| Defined in header `<locale>` |  |  |
| public:  const CharT\* scan_is( mask m, const CharT\* beg, const CharT\* end ) const; | (1) |  |
| protected:  virtual const CharT\* do_scan_is( mask m, const CharT\* beg, const CharT\* end ) const; | (2) |  |
|  |  |  |

1) Public member function, calls the protected virtual member function `do_scan_is` of the most derived class.2) Locates the first character in the character array `[`beg`,`end`)` that satisfies the classification mask m, that is, the first character c such that is(m, c) would return true.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| m | - | mask to search for |
| beg | - | pointer to the first character in an array of characters to search |
| end | - | one past the end pointer for the array of characters to search |

### Return value

Pointer to the first character in `[`beg`,`end`)` that satisfies the mask, or end if no such character was found.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <clocale>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
    auto& f = std::use_facet<std::ctype<wchar_t>>(std::wcout.getloc());
 
    // skip until the first letter
    wchar_t s1[] = L"      \t\t\n  Кошка";
    const wchar_t* p1 = f.scan_is(std::ctype_base::alpha, std::begin(s1), std::end(s1));
    std::wcout << '\'' << p1 << "'\n";
 
    // skip until the first letter
    wchar_t s2[] = L"123456789ネプネプ";
    const wchar_t* p2 = f.scan_is(std::ctype_base::alpha, std::begin(s2), std::end(s2));
    std::wcout << '\'' << p2 << "'\n";
}

```

Output:

```
'Кошка'
'ネプネプ'

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 152 | C++98 | the effect of `do_scan_is` mentioned is(m), but is does not have such an overload | corrected to is(m, c) |

| scan_is | locates the first character in a sequence that conforms to given classification, using the classification table   (public member function of `std::ctype<char>`) |
| do_scan_not[virtual] | locates the first character in a sequence that fails given classification   (virtual protected member function) |
