| Defined in header `<locale>` |  |  |
| template<  class CharT,      class OutputIt = std::ostreambuf_iterator<CharT> > class time_put_byname : public std::time_put<CharT, OutputIt> |  |  |
|  |  |  |

`std::time_put_byname` is a std::time_put facet which encapsulates time and date formatting rules of the locale specified at its construction.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:

- `CharT` is one of char and wchar_t, and
- `OutputIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `char_type` | `CharT` |
| `iter_type` | `OutputIt` |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ****(constructor)**** | constructs a new `time_put_byname` facet   (public member function) |
| ****(destructor)**** | destroys a `time_put_byname` facet   (protected member function) |

## std::time_put_byname::time_put_byname

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| explicit time_put_byname( const char\* name, std::size_t refs = 0 ); |  |  |
| explicit time_put_byname( const std::string& name, std::size_t refs = 0 ); |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Constructs a new `std::time_put_byname` facet for a locale with name.

refs is used for resource management: if refs == 0, the implementation destroys the facet, when the last std::locale object holding it is destroyed. Otherwise, the object is not destroyed.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | - | the name of the locale |
| refs | - | the number of references that link to the facet |

## std::time_put_byname::~time_put_byname

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| protected:  ~time_put_byname(); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Destroys the facet.

## Inherited from std::time_put

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member | Description |
| std::locale::id `id` [static] | the identifier of the facet |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| put | invokes `do_put`   (public member function of `std::time_put<CharT,OutputIt>`) |

### Protected member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| do_put[virtual] | formats date/time and writes to output stream   (virtual protected member function of `std::time_put<CharT,OutputIt>`) |

### Example

Prints current time using the "C" locale with the `time_put` facet replaced by various `std::time_put_byname` facets. The result shown was obtained using the clang compiler.

Run this code

```
#include <codecvt>
#include <ctime>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);
    std::wbuffer_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>> conv(std::cout.rdbuf());
    std::wostream out(&conv);
 
    out.imbue(std::locale(out.getloc(),
                          new std::time_put_byname<wchar_t>("ja_JP.utf8")));
    out << std::put_time(std::localtime(&t), L"%A %c") << '\n';
 
    out.imbue(std::locale(out.getloc(),
                          new std::time_put_byname<wchar_t>("ru_RU.utf8")));
    out << std::put_time(std::localtime(&t), L"%A %c") << '\n';
 
    out.imbue(std::locale(out.getloc(),
                          new std::time_put_byname<wchar_t>("sv_SE.utf8")));
    out << std::put_time(std::localtime(&t), L"%A %c") << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
