The concept `destructible` specifies the concept of all types whose instances can safely be destroyed at the end of their lifetime (including reference types).

### Notes

Unlike the Destructible named requirement, `std::destructible` requires the destructor to be noexcept(true), not merely non-throwing when invoked, and allows reference types and array types.
