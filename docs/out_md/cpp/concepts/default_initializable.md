| Defined in header `<concepts>` |  |  |
| template< class T >  concept default_initializable = std::constructible_from<T> && requires { T{}; } && /\* T t; is well-formed, see below \*/; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The `default_initializable` concept checks whether variables of type `T` can be

- value-initialized (i.e., whether T() is well-formed);
- direct-list-initialized from an empty initializer list (i.e., whether T{} is well-formed); and
- default-initialized (i.e., whether T t; is well-formed).

Access checking is performed as if in a context unrelated to T. Only the validity of the immediate context of the variable initialization is considered.

### Possible implementation

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class T> concept default_initializable =     std::constructible_from<T> &&     requires { T{}; ::new T; }; ``` |
