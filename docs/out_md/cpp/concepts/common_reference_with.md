| Defined in header `<concepts>` |  |  |
| template< class T, class U >  concept common_reference_with =      std::same_as<std::common_reference_t<T, U>, std::common_reference_t<U, T>> &&      std::convertible_to<T, std::common_reference_t<T, U>> && std::convertible_to<U, std::common_reference_t<T, U>>; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The concept `common_reference_with<T, U>` specifies that two types `T` and `U` share a **common reference type** (as computed by std::common_reference_t) to which both can be converted.

### Semantic requirements

T and U model std::common_reference_with<T, U> only if, given equality-preserving expressions `t1`, `t2`, `u1` and `u2` such that decltype((t1)) and decltype((t2)) are both `T` and decltype((u1)) and decltype((u2)) are both `U`,

- std::common_reference_t<T, U>(t1) equals std::common_reference_t<T, U>(t2) if and only if `t1` equals `t2`; and
- std::common_reference_t<T, U>(u1) equals std::common_reference_t<T, U>(u2) if and only if `u1` equals `u2`.

In other words, the conversion to the common reference type must preserve equality.
