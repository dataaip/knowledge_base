| template< class T >  concept movable =      std::is_object_v<T> &&      std::move_constructible<T> &&      std::assignable_from<T&, T> && std::swappable<T>; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The concept `movable<T>` specifies that `T` is an object type that can be moved (that is, it can be move constructed, move assigned, and lvalues of type `T` can be swapped).
