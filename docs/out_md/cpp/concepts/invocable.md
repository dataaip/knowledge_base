| template< class F, class... Args >  concept invocable =      requires(F&& f, Args&&... args) {          std::invoke(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...);               /\* not required to be equality-preserving \*/ }; |  | (since C++20) |
| template< class F, class... Args >  concept regular_invocable = std::invocable<F, Args...>; |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

The `invocable` concept specifies that a callable type `F` can be called with a set of arguments `Args...` using the function template std::invoke.

The `regular_invocable` concept adds to the `invocable` concept by requiring the `invoke` expression to be equality-preserving and not modify either the function object or the arguments.

### Equality preservation

Expressions declared in requires expressions of the standard library concepts are required to be equality-preserving (except where stated otherwise).

### Notes

The distinction between `invocable` and `regular_invocable` is purely semantic.

A random number generator may satisfy `invocable` but cannot satisfy `regular_invocable` (comical ones excluded).
