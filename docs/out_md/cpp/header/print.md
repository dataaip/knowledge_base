This header is part of the Input/Output library.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Functions | |
| print(C++23) | prints to stdout or a file stream using formatted representation of the arguments   (function template) |
| println(C++23) | same as std::print except that each print is terminated by additional new line   (function template) |
| vprint_unicodevprint_unicode_buffered(C++23) | prints to Unicode capable stdout or a file stream using type-erased argument representation   (function) |
| vprint_nonunicodevprint_nonunicode_buffered(C++23) | prints to stdout or a file stream using type-erased argument representation   (function) |
