| Classes | |
| basic_ostream | wraps a given abstract device (std::basic_streambuf) and provides high-level output interface   (class template) |
| std::ostream | std::basic_ostream<char>  (typedef) |
| std::wostream | std::basic_ostream<wchar_t>  (typedef) |
| Functions | |
| operator<<(std::basic_ostream) | inserts character data or insert into rvalue stream   (function template) |
| print(std::ostream)(C++23) | outputs formatted representation of the arguments   (function template) |
| println(std::ostream)(C++23) | outputs formatted representation of the arguments with appended '\n'   (function template) |
| vprint_unicode(std::ostream)(C++23) | performs Unicode aware output using type-erased argument representation   (function) |
| vprint_nonunicode(std::ostream)(C++23) | outputs character data using type-erased argument representation   (function) |
| Manipulators | |
| endl | outputs '\n' and flushes the output stream   (function template) |
| ends | outputs '\0'   (function template) |
| flush | flushes the output stream   (function template) |
| emit_on_flushnoemit_on_flush(C++20) | controls whether a stream's basic_syncbuf emits on flush   (function template) |
| flush_emit(C++20) | flushes a stream and emits the content if it is using a basic_syncbuf   (function template) |
