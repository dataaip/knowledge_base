| --- | --- |
| Classes | |
| condition_variable(C++11) | provides a condition variable associated with a std::unique_lock   (class) |
| condition_variable_any(C++11) | provides a condition variable associated with any lock type   (class) |
| cv_status(C++11) | lists the possible results of timed waits on condition variables   (enum) |
| Functions | |
| notify_all_at_thread_exit(C++11) | schedules a call to `notify_all` to be invoked when this thread is completely finished   (function) |
