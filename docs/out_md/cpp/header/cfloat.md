This header was originally in the C standard library as <float.h>.

This header is part of the type support library, in particular, it is a part of the C numeric limits interface.

### Macros

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| FLT_RADIX | the radix (integer base) used by the representation of all three floating-point types   (macro constant) |
| DECIMAL_DIG(C++11) | conversion from long double to decimal with at least DECIMAL_DIG digits and back to long double is the identity conversion: this is the decimal precision required to serialize/deserialize a long double (see also std::numeric_limits::max_digits10)   (macro constant) |
| FLT_DECIMAL_DIGDBL_DECIMAL_DIGLDBL_DECIMAL_DIG(C++17) | conversion from float/double/long double to decimal with at least FLT_DECIMAL_DIG/DBL_DECIMAL_DIG/LDBL_DECIMAL_DIG digits and back is the identity conversion: this is the decimal precision required to serialize/deserialize a floating-point value (see also std::numeric_limits::max_digits10). Defined to at least 6, 10, and 10 respectively, or 9 for IEEE float and 17 for IEEE double.   (macro constant) |
| FLT_MINDBL_MINLDBL_MIN | minimum normalized positive value of float, double and long double respectively   (macro constant) |
| FLT_TRUE_MINDBL_TRUE_MINLDBL_TRUE_MIN(C++17) | minimum positive value of float, double and long double respectively   (macro constant) |
| FLT_MAXDBL_MAXLDBL_MAX | maximum finite value of float, double and long double respectively   (macro constant) |
| FLT_EPSILONDBL_EPSILONLDBL_EPSILON | difference between 1.0 and the next representable value for float, double and long double respectively   (macro constant) |
| FLT_DIGDBL_DIGLDBL_DIG | number of decimal digits that are guaranteed to be preserved in text â†’ float/double/long double â†’ text roundtrip without change due to rounding or overflow (see std::numeric_limits::digits10 for explanation)   (macro constant) |
| FLT_MANT_DIGDBL_MANT_DIGLDBL_MANT_DIG | number of base FLT_RADIX digits that can be represented without losing precision for float, double and long double respectively   (macro constant) |
| FLT_MIN_EXPDBL_MIN_EXPLDBL_MIN_EXP | minimum negative integer such that FLT_RADIX raised by power one less than that integer is a normalized float, double and long double respectively   (macro constant) |
| FLT_MIN_10_EXPDBL_MIN_10_EXPLDBL_MIN_10_EXP | minimum negative integer such that 10 raised to that power is a normalized float, double and long double respectively   (macro constant) |
| FLT_MAX_EXPDBL_MAX_EXPLDBL_MAX_EXP | maximum positive integer such that FLT_RADIX raised by power one less than that integer is a representable finite float, double and long double respectively   (macro constant) |
| FLT_MAX_10_EXPDBL_MAX_10_EXPLDBL_MAX_10_EXP | maximum positive integer such that 10 raised to that power is a representable finite float, double and long double respectively   (macro constant) |
| FLT_ROUNDS | default rounding mode of floating-point arithmetic   (macro constant) |
| FLT_EVAL_METHOD(C++11) | specifies in what precision all arithmetic operations are done   (macro constant) |
| FLT_HAS_SUBNORMDBL_HAS_SUBNORMLDBL_HAS_SUBNORM(C++17) | specifies whether the type supports subnormal (denormal) numbers: -1 â€“ indeterminable, â€‹0â€‹ â€“ absent, 1 â€“ present   (macro constant) |
