This header is part of the numeric library.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Types | |
| endian(C++20) | indicates the endianness of scalar types   (enum) |
| Functions | |
| bit_cast(C++20) | reinterpret the object representation of one type as that of another   (function template) |
| byteswap(C++23) | reverses the bytes in the given integer value   (function template) |
| has_single_bit(C++20) | checks if a number is an integral power of 2   (function template) |
| bit_ceil(C++20) | finds the smallest integral power of 2 not less than the given value   (function template) |
| bit_floor(C++20) | finds the largest integral power of 2 not greater than the given value   (function template) |
| bit_width(C++20) | finds the smallest number of bits needed to represent the given value   (function template) |
| rotl(C++20) | computes the result of bitwise left-rotation   (function template) |
