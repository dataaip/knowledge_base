| --- | --- |
| Classes | |
| rcu_obj_base")(C++26) | allows an object to be protected by RCU   (class template) |
| rcu_domain")(C++26) | provides regions of RCU protection   (class) |
| Functions | |
| rcu_default_domain")(C++26) | returns a reference to a static-duration object of type `std::rcu_domain`   (function) |
| rcu_synchronize")(C++26) | blocks until a protection region unlocks on a RCU domain   (function) |
| rcu_barrier")(C++26) | may evaluate scheduled operations on a RCU domain and blocks until all preceding evaluations are complete   (function) |
| rcu_retire")(C++26) | schedules the evaluation of a specified function on a RCU domain, potentially allocating memory, and invoking scheduled evaluations   (function template) |
