This header is part of the ranges library.

### Core language concepts

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in namespace `std::experimental::ranges` | |
| Same | specifies that a type is the same as another type   (concept) |
| DerivedFrom | specifies that a type is derived from another type   (concept) |
| ConvertibleTo | specifies that a type is implicitly convertible to another type   (concept) |
| CommonReference | specifies that two types share a common reference type   (concept) |
| Common | specifies that two types share a common type   (concept) |
| Integral | specifies that a type is an integral type   (concept) |
| SignedIntegral | specifies that a type is an integral type that is signed   (concept) |
| UnsignedIntegral | specifies that a type is an integral type that is not signed   (concept) |
| Assignable | specifies that a type is assignable from another type   (concept) |
| SwappableSwappableWith | specifies that a type can be swapped or that two types can be swapped with each other   (concept) |

### Comparison concepts

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in namespace `std::experimental::ranges` | |
| Boolean | specifies that a type can be used in Boolean contexts   (concept) |
| WeaklyEqualityComparableWith | specifies that two types can be compared for equality using operators == and !=   (concept) |
| EqualityComparableEqualityComparableWith | specifies that operator == is an equivalence relation   (concept) |
| StrictTotallyOrderedStrictTotallyOrderedWith | specifies that the comparison operators on the type yield a total order   (concept) |

### Object concepts

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in namespace `std::experimental::ranges` | |
| Destructible | specifies that an object of the type can be destroyed   (concept) |
| Constructible | specifies that a variable of the type can be constructed from or bound to a set of argument types   (concept) |
| DefaultConstructible | specifies that an object of a type can be default constructed   (concept) |
| MoveConstructible | specifies that an object of a type can be move constructed   (concept) |
| CopyConstructible | specifies that an object of a type can be copy constructed and move constructed   (concept) |
| Movable | specifies that an object of a type can be moved and swapped   (concept) |
| Copyable | specifies that an object of a type can be copied, moved, and swapped   (concept) |
| Semiregular | specifies that an object of a type can be copied, moved, swapped, and default constructed   (concept) |
| Regular | specifies that a type is regular, that is, it is both `Semiregular` and `EqualityComparable`   (concept) |

### Callable concepts

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in namespace `std::experimental::ranges` | |
| InvocableRegularInvocable | specifies that a callable type can be invoked with a given set of argument types   (concept) |
| Predicate | specifies that a callable type is a Boolean predicate   (concept) |
| Relation | specifies that a callable type is a binary relation   (concept) |
| StrictWeakOrder | specifies that a `Relation` imposes a strict weak ordering   (concept) |
