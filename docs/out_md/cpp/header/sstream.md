### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 170 | C++98 | the definitions of `traits_type` were missing in the synopses of std::basic_ostringstream and std::basic_stringstream | added |
| LWG 251 | C++98 | the definitions of `allocator_type` were missing in the synopses of std::basic_stringbuf, std::basic_istringstream std::basic_ostringstream and std::basic_stringstream | added |
