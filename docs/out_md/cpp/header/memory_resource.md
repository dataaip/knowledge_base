| Classes | |
| Defined in namespace `std::pmr` | |
| polymorphic_allocator(C++17) | an allocator that supports run-time polymorphism based on the std::pmr::memory_resource it is constructed with   (class template) |
| memory_resource(C++17) | an abstract interface for classes that encapsulate memory resources   (class) |
| pool_options(C++17) | a set of constructor options for pool resources   (class) |
| synchronized_pool_resource(C++17) | a thread-safe std::pmr::memory_resource for managing allocations in pools of different block sizes   (class) |

| monotonic_buffer_resource(C++17) | a special-purpose std::pmr::memory_resource that releases the allocated memory only when the resource is destroyed   (class) |
| Functions | |
| Defined in namespace `std::pmr` | |
| new_delete_resource(C++17) | returns a static program-wide std::pmr::memory_resource that uses the global operator new and operator delete to allocate and deallocate memory   (function) |

| get_default_resource(C++17) | gets the default std::pmr::memory_resource   (function) |
| set_default_resource(C++17) | sets the default std::pmr::memory_resource   (function) |
