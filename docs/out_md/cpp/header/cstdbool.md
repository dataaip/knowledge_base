This header was originally in the C standard library as <stdbool.h>.

Compatibility header. true, false and bool are keywords in C++, but they were not keywords in C until C23.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Macros | |
| __bool_true_false_are_defined(C++11)(deprecated) | C compatibility macro constant, expands to integer literal 1   (macro constant) |

### Notes

`<cstdbool>` is deprecated in C++17 and removed in C++20. Corresponding `<stdbool.h>` is still available in C++20.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3827 | C++11 | C programs no longer need the compatibility macro `__bool_true_false_are_defined` since C23 | deprecated this macro in C++ |
