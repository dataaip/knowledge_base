This header was originally in the C standard library as <time.h>.

This header is part of the C-style date and time library.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Macro constants | |
| CLOCKS_PER_SEC | number of processor clock ticks per second   (macro constant) |
| NULL | implementation-defined null pointer constant   (macro constant) |
| Types | |
| clock_t | process running time   (typedef) |
| size_t | unsigned integer type returned by the sizeof operator   (typedef) |
| time_t | time since epoch type   (typedef) |
| tm | calendar time type   (class) |
| timespec(C++17) | time in seconds and nanoseconds (struct) |
| Functions | |
| Time manipulation | |
| clock | returns raw processor clock time since the program is started   (function) |
| time | returns the current time of the system as time since epoch   (function) |
| difftime | computes the difference between times   (function) |
| timespec_get(C++17) | returns the calendar time in seconds and nanoseconds based on a given time base   (function) |
| Format conversions | |
| ctime | converts a std::time_t object to a textual representation   (function) |
| asctime | converts a std::tm object to a textual representation   (function) |
| strftime | converts a std::tm object to custom textual representation   (function) |
| gmtime | converts time since epoch to calendar time expressed as Universal Coordinated Time   (function) |
| localtime | converts time since epoch to calendar time expressed as local time   (function) |
| mktime | converts calendar time to time since epoch   (function) |
