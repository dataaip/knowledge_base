|  |  |  |

`fpos_t` is a non-array complete object type, can be used to store (by fgetpos) and restore (by fsetpos) the position and multibyte parser state (if any) for a C stream.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The multibyte parser state of a wide-oriented C stream is represented by a mbstate_t object, whose value is stored as part of the value of a `fpos_t` object by fgetpos. | (since C95) |
