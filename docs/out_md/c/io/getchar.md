| int getchar( void ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Reads the next character from stdin.

Equivalent to getc(stdin).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The obtained character on success or EOF on failure.

If the failure has been caused by end-of-file condition, additionally sets the **eof** indicator (see feof()) on stdin. If the failure has been caused by some other error, sets the **error** indicator (see ferror()) on stdin.

### Example

Demonstrates `getchar` with error checking

Run this code

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    for (int ch; (ch = getchar()) != EOF;) // read/print "abcde" from stdin
        printf("%c", ch);
 
    // Test reason for reaching EOF.
    if (feof(stdin)) // if failure caused by end-of-file condition
        puts("End of file reached");
    else if (ferror(stdin)) // if failure caused by some other error
    {
        perror("getchar()");
        fprintf(stderr, "getchar() failed in file %s at line # %d\n",
                __FILE__, __LINE__ - 9);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
 
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

```

Possible output:

```
abcde
End of file reached

```
