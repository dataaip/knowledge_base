| size_t wcsftime( wchar_t\* str, size_t count, const wchar_t\* format, const struct tm\* time ); |  | (since C95) |
|  |  |  |

Converts the date and time information from a given calendar time `time` to a null-terminated wide character string str according to format string format. Up to count bytes are written.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| str | - | pointer to the first element of the wchar_t array for output |
| count | - | maximum number of wide characters to write |
| format | - | pointer to a null-terminated wide character string specifying the format of conversion |

### Format string

The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and ordinary characters (except `%`). All ordinary characters, including the terminating null character, are copied to the output string without modification. Each conversion specification begins with `%` character, optionally followed by `E` or `O` modifier (ignored if unsupported by the locale), followed by the character that determines the behavior of the specifier. The following format specifiers are available:

| Conversion  specifier | Explanation | Used fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `%` | writes literal `%`. The full conversion specification must be `%%`. |  |
| `n` (C99) | writes newline character |  |
| `t` (C99) | writes horizontal tab character |  |
| Year | | |
| `Y` | writes ****year**** as a decimal number, e.g. 2017 | `tm_year` |
| `EY` (C99) | writes ****year**** in the alternative representation, e.g.平成23年 (year Heisei 23) instead of 2011年 (year 2011) in ja_JP locale | `tm_year` |
| `y` | writes last 2 digits of ****year**** as a decimal number (range `[00,99]`) | `tm_year` |

| `Ey` (C99) | writes ****year**** as offset from locale's alternative calendar period `%EC` (locale-dependent) | `tm_year` |
| `C` (C99) | writes first 2 digits of ****year**** as a decimal number (range `[00,99]`) | `tm_year` |

### Return value

Number of wide characters written into the wide character array pointed to by str not including the terminating L'\0' on success. If count was reached before the entire string could be stored, ​0​ is returned and the contents are undefined.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <locale.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <wchar.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    wchar_t buff[40];
    struct tm my_time =
    {
        .tm_year = 112, // = year 2012
        .tm_mon = 9,    // = 10th month
        .tm_mday = 9,   // = 9th day
        .tm_hour = 8,   // = 8 hours
        .tm_min = 10,   // = 10 minutes
        .tm_sec = 20    // = 20 secs
    };
 
    if (wcsftime(buff, sizeof buff, L"%A %c", &my_time))
        printf("%ls\n", buff);
    else
        puts("wcsftime failed");
 
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "ja_JP.utf8");
 
    if (wcsftime(buff, sizeof buff, L"%A %c", &my_time))
        printf("%ls\n", buff);
    else
        puts("wcsftime failed");
}

```

Output:

```
