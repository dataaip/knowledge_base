| Defined in header `<string.h>` |  |  |
| size_t strcspn( const char \*dest, const char \*src ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns the length of the maximum initial segment of the null-terminated byte string pointed to by `dest`, that consists of only the characters **not** found in the null-terminated byte string pointed to by `src`.

The behavior is undefined if either `dest` or `src` is not a pointer to a null-terminated byte string.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dest | - | pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be analyzed |
| src | - | pointer to the null-terminated byte string that contains the characters to search for |

### Return value

The length of the maximum initial segment that contains only characters not found in the null-terminated byte string pointed to by `src`

### Notes

The function name stands for "complementary span" because the function searches for characters not found in `src`, that is the complement of `src`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    const char *string = "abcde312$#@";
    const char *invalid = "*$#";
 
    size_t valid_len = strcspn(string, invalid);
    if(valid_len != strlen(string))
       printf("'%s' contains invalid chars starting at position %zu\n",
               string, valid_len);
}

```

Output:

```
'abcde312$#@' contains invalid chars starting at position 8

```
