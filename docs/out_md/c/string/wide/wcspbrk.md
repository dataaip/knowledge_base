|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<wchar.h>` |  |  |
| wchar_t \*wcspbrk( const wchar_t \*dest, const wchar_t \*str ); | (1) | (since C95) |
| /\*QWchar_t\*/ \*wcspbrk( /\*QWchar_t\*/ \*dest, const wchar_t \*str ); | (2) | (since C23) |
|  |  |  |

1) Finds the first character in wide string pointed to by `dest`, that is also in wide string pointed to by `str`.2) Type-generic function equivalent to (1). Let `T` be an unqualified wide character object type.

:   - If `dest` is of type const T\*, the return type is const wchar_t\*.
    - Otherwise, if `dest` is of type T\*, the return type is wchar_t\*.
    - Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

If a macro definition of each of these generic functions is suppressed to access an actual function (e.g. if (wcspbrk) or a function pointer is used), the actual function declaration (1) becomes visible.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dest | - | pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be analyzed |
| src | - | pointer to the null-terminated wide string that contains the characters to search for |

### Return value

Pointer to the first character in `dest`, that is also in `str`, or a null pointer if no such character exists.

### Notes

The name stands for "wide character string pointer break", because it returns a pointer to the first of the separator ("break") characters.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    const wchar_t* str = L"Hello world, friend of mine!";
    const wchar_t* sep = L" ,!";
 
    unsigned int cnt = 0;
    do {
       str = wcspbrk(str, sep); // find separator
       if (str) str += wcsspn(str, sep); // skip separator
       ++cnt; // increment word count
    } while (str && *str);
 
    wprintf(L"There are %u words.\n", cnt);
}

```

Output:

```
There are 5 words.

```
