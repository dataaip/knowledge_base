|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<wchar.h>` |  |  |
| wchar_t \*wcsstr( const wchar_t \*dest, const wchar_t \*src ); | (1) | (since C95) |
| /\*QWchar_t\*/ \*wcsstr( /\*QWchar_t\*/ \*dest, const wchar_t \*src ); | (2) | (since C23) |
|  |  |  |

1) Finds the first occurrence of the wide string `src` in the wide string pointed to by `dest`. The terminating null characters are not compared.2) Type-generic function equivalent to (1). Let `T` be an unqualified wide character object type.

:   - If `dest` is of type const T\*, the return type is const wchar_t\*.
    - Otherwise, if `dest` is of type T\*, the return type is wchar_t\*.
    - Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

If a macro definition of each of these generic functions is suppressed to access an actual function (e.g. if (wcsstr) or a function pointer is used), the actual function declaration (1) becomes visible.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dest | - | pointer to the null-terminated wide string to examine |
| src | - | pointer to the null-terminated wide string to search for |

### Return value

Pointer to the first character of the found substring in `dest`, or a null pointer if no such substring is found. If `src` points to an empty string, `dest` is returned.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <locale.h>
#include <wchar.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "ru_RU.UTF-8");
 
    wchar_t str[5][64] = {
        L"Строка, где есть подстрока 'но'.",
        L"Строка, где такой подстроки нет.",
        L"Он здесь.",
        L"Здесь он.",
        L"Его нет."
    };
 
    for (size_t i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        if (wcsstr(str[i], L"но")) {
            wprintf(L"%ls\n", str[i]);
        }
    }
}

```

Output:

```
Строка, где есть подстрока 'но'.

```
