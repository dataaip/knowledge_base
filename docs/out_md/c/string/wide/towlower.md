| Defined in header `<wctype.h>` |  |  |
| wint_t towlower( wint_t wc ); |  | (since C95) |
|  |  |  |

Converts the given wide character to lowercase, if possible.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wc | - | wide character to be converted |

### Return value

Lowercase version of wc or unmodified wc if no lowercase version is listed in the current C locale.

### Notes

Only 1:1 character mapping can be performed by this function, e.g. the Greek uppercase letter 'Σ' has two lowercase forms, depending on the position in a word: 'σ' and 'ς'. A call to `towlower` cannot be used to obtain the correct lowercase form in this case.

ISO 30112 specifies which pairs of Unicode characters are included in this mapping.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <locale.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <wctype.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    wchar_t wc = L'\u0190'; // Latin capital open E ('Ɛ')
    printf("in the default locale, towlower(%#x) = %#x\n", wc, towlower(wc));
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    printf("in Unicode locale, towlower(%#x) = %#x\n", wc, towlower(wc));
}

```

Output:

```
in the default locale, towlower(0x190) = 0x190
in Unicode locale, towlower(0x190) = 0x25b

```
