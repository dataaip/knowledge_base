|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<wchar.h>` |  |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | (1) |  |
| wchar_t\* wmemcpy( wchar_t\* dest, const wchar_t\* src, size_t count ); |  | (since C95)  (until C99) |
| wchar_t \*wmemcpy(wchar_t \*restrict dest, const wchar_t \*restrict src,                   size_t count ); |  | (since C99) |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| errno_t wmemcpy_s( wchar_t \*restrict dest, rsize_t destsz,                     const wchar_t \*restrict src, rsize_t count ); | (2) | (since C11) |
|  |  |  |

1) Copies exactly `count` successive wide characters from the wide character array pointed to by `src` to the wide character array pointed to by `dest`. If the objects overlap, the behavior is undefined. If `count` is zero, the function does nothing.2) Same as (1), except that the following errors are detected at runtime and call the currently installed constraint handler function:

:   - `src` or `dest` is a null pointer
    - `destsz` or `count` is greater than RSIZE_MAX/sizeof(wchar_t)
    - `count` is greater than `destsz` (overflow would occur)
    - overlap would occur between the source and the destination arrays
:   As with all bounds-checked functions, `wmemcpy_s` is only guaranteed to be available if __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined by the implementation and if the user defines __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ to the integer constant 1 before including <wchar.h>.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dest | - | pointer to the wide character array to copy to |
| src | - | pointer to the wide character array to copy from |
| count | - | number of wide characters to copy |
| destsz | - | max number of wide characters to write (the size of the destination buffer) |

### Return value

1) returns a copy of `dest`2) returns zero on success, returns non-zero on error. Also, on error, fills the entire `dst` up to and not including dst+dstsz with null wide characters, L'\0' (unless `dest` is null or `destsz` is greater than RSIZE_MAX/sizeof(wchar_t))

### Notes

This function's analog for byte strings is strncpy, not strcpy.

This function is not locale-sensitive and pays no attention to the values of the wchar_t objects it copies: nulls as well as invalid characters are copied too.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <locale.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    wchar_t from1[] = L"नमस्ते";
    size_t sz1 = sizeof from1 / sizeof *from1;
    wchar_t from2[] = L"Բարև";
    size_t sz2 = sizeof from2 / sizeof *from2;
    wchar_t to[sz1 + sz2];
    wmemcpy(to, from1, sz1); // copy from1, along with its null terminator
    wmemcpy(to + sz1, from2, sz2); // append from2, along with its null terminator
 
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    printf("Wide array contains: ");
    for(size_t n = 0; n < sizeof to / sizeof *to; ++n)
        if(to[n])
            printf("%lc", to[n]);
        else
            printf("\\0");
    printf("\n");
}

```

Possible output:

```
Wide array contains: नमस्ते\0Բարև\0

```
