|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<wchar.h>` |  |  |
| wchar_t \*wcschr( const wchar_t \*str, wchar_t ch ); | (1) | (since C95) |
| /\*QWchar_t\*/ \*wcschr( /\*QWchar_t\*/ \*str, wchar_t ch ); | (2) | (since C23) |
|  |  |  |

1) Finds the first occurrence of the wide character `ch` in the wide string pointed to by `str`.2) Type-generic function equivalent to (1). Let `T` be an unqualified wide character object type.

:   - If `str` is of type const T\*, the return type is const wchar_t\*.
    - Otherwise, if `str` is of type T\*, the return type is wchar_t\*.
    - Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

If a macro definition of each of these generic functions is suppressed to access an actual function (e.g. if (wcschr) or a function pointer is used), the actual function declaration (1) becomes visible.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| str | - | pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be analyzed |
| ch | - | wide character to search for |

### Return value

Pointer to the found character in `str`, or a null pointer if no such character is found.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <wchar.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <locale.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    wchar_t arr[] = L"白猫 黒猫 кошки";
    wchar_t *cat = wcschr(arr, L'猫');
    wchar_t *dog = wcschr(arr, L'犬');
 
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    if(cat)
        printf("The character 猫 found at position %td\n", cat-arr);
    else
        puts("The character 猫 not found");
 
    if(dog)
        printf("The character 犬 found at position %td\n", dog-arr);
    else
        puts("The character 犬 not found");
}

```

Output:

```
The character 猫 found at position 1
The character 犬 not found

```
