| Defined in header `<wchar.h>` |  |  |
| size_t wcscspn( const wchar_t\* dest, const wchar_t\* src ); |  | (since C95) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the length of the maximum initial segment of the wide string pointed to by `dest`, that consists of only the characters **not** found in wide string pointed to by `src`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dest | - | pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be analyzed |
| src | - | pointer to the null-terminated wide string that contains the characters to search for |

### Return value

The length of the maximum initial segment that contains only characters not found in the character string pointed to by `src`

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <locale.h>
#include <wchar.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    wchar_t dest[] = L"白猫 黑狗 甲虫";
    /*                      └───┐   */
    const wchar_t *src = L"甲虫,黑狗";
 
    const size_t len = wcscspn(dest, src);
    dest[len] = L'\0'; /* terminates the segment to print it out */
 
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    wprintf(L"The length of maximum initial segment is %td.\n"
            L"The segment is \"%ls\".\n", len, dest);
}

```

Output:

```
The length of maximum initial segment is 3.
The segment is "白猫 ".

```
