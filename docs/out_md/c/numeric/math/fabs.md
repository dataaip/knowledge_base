1-6) Computes the absolute value of a floating-point value arg.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The functions with decimal floating-point parameters are declared if and only if the implementation predefines `__STDC_IEC_60559_DFP__` (i.e. the implementation supports decimal floating-point numbers). | (since C23) |

7) Type-generic macro: If the argument has type _Decimal128, _Decimal64, _Decimal32,(since C23)long double, double, or float, `fabsd128`, `fabsd64`, `fabsd32`,(since C23)`fabsl`, `fabs`, or `fabsf` is called, respectively. Otherwise, if the argument has integer type, `fabs` is called. Otherwise, if the argument is complex, then the macro invokes the corresponding complex function (cabsf, cabs, cabsl). Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arg | - | floating-point value |
| arith | - | floating-point or integer value |

### Return value

If successful, returns the absolute value of arg (\(\small |arg| \)|arg|). The value returned is exact and does not depend on any rounding modes.

### Error handling

This function is not subject to any of the error conditions specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If the argument is ±0, +0 is returned.
- If the argument is ±∞, +∞ is returned.
- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
 
#define PI 3.14159
 
// This numerical integration assumes all area is positive.
double integrate(double f(double),
                 double a, double b, // assume a < b
                 unsigned steps) // assume steps > 0
{
    const double dx = (b - a) / steps;
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (double x = a; x < b; x += dx)

```

Output:

```
fabs(+3) = 3.000000
fabs(-3) = 3.000000
fabs(-0) = 0.000000
fabs(-Inf) = inf
Area under sin(x) in [-PI, PI] = 4.000000

```
