1-6) Computes the arc tangent of y / x using the signs of arguments to determine the correct quadrant.7) Type-generic macro: If any argument has type long double, (3) (`atan2l`) is called. Otherwise, if any argument has integer type or has type double, (2) (`atan2`) is called. Otherwise, (1) (`atan2f`) is called.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The functions (4-6) are declared if and only if the implementation predefines `__STDC_IEC_60559_DFP__` (i.e. the implementation supports decimal floating-point numbers). | (since C23) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x, y | - | floating-point value |

### Return value

If no errors occur, the arc tangent of y / x (arctan(

|  |
| --- |
| y |
| x |

)) in the range [-π ; +π] radians, is returned.Y argumentReturn valueX argument

If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned.

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in `math_errhandling`.

Domain error may occur if x and y are both zero.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

- If x and y are both zero, domain error **does not** occur;
- If x and y are both zero, range error does not occur either;
- If y is zero, pole error does not occur;
- If y is `±0` and x is negative or `-0`, `±π` is returned;
- If y is `±0` and x is positive or `+0`, `±0` is returned;
- If y is `±∞` and x is finite, `±π/2` is returned;
- If y is `±∞` and x is `-∞`, `±3π/4` is returned;
- If y is `±∞` and x is `+∞`, `±π/4` is returned;
- If x is `±0` and y is negative, `-π/2` is returned;
- If x is `±0` and y is positive, `+π/2` is returned;
- If x is `-∞` and y is finite and positive, `+π` is returned;
- If x is `-∞` and y is finite and negative, `-π` is returned;
- If x is `+∞` and y is finite and positive, `+0` is returned;
- If x is `+∞` and y is finite and negative, `-0` is returned;
- If either x is NaN or y is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

atan2(y, x) is equivalent to carg(x + I\*y).

POSIX specifies that in case of underflow, y / x is the value returned, and if that is not supported, an implementation-defined value no greater than DBL_MIN, FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN is returned.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    // normal usage: the signs of the two arguments determine the quadrant
    // atan2(1,1) = +pi/4, Quad I
    printf("(+1,+1) cartesian is (%f,%f) polar\n", hypot( 1, 1), atan2( 1, 1));
    // atan2(1, -1) = +3pi/4, Quad II
    printf("(+1,-1) cartesian is (%f,%f) polar\n", hypot( 1,-1), atan2( 1,-1));
    // atan2(-1,-1) = -3pi/4, Quad III
    printf("(-1,-1) cartesian is (%f,%f) polar\n", hypot(-1,-1), atan2(-1,-1));
    // atan2(-1,-1) = -pi/4, Quad IV
    printf("(-1,+1) cartesian is (%f,%f) polar\n", hypot(-1, 1), atan2(-1, 1));
 
    // special values
    printf("atan2(0, 0) = %f atan2(0, -0)=%f\n", atan2(0,0), atan2(0,-0.0));
    printf("atan2(7, 0) = %f atan2(7, -0)=%f\n", atan2(7,0), atan2(7,-0.0));
}

```

Output:

```
(+1,+1) cartesian is (1.414214,0.785398) polar
(+1,-1) cartesian is (1.414214,2.356194) polar
(-1,-1) cartesian is (1.414214,-2.356194) polar
(-1,+1) cartesian is (1.414214,-0.785398) polar
atan2(0, 0) = 0.000000 atan2(0, -0)=3.141593
atan2(7, 0) = 1.570796 atan2(7, -0)=1.570796

```
