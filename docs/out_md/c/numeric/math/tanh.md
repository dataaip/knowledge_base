| float       tanhf( float arg ); | (1) | (since C99) |

| long double tanhl( long double arg ); | (3) | (since C99) |

1-3) Computes the hyperbolic tangent of arg.4) Type-generic macro: If the argument has type long double, `tanhl` is called. Otherwise, if the argument has integer type or the type double, `tanh` is called. Otherwise, `tanhf` is called. If the argument is complex, then the macro invokes the corresponding complex function (ctanhf, ctanh, ctanhl).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arg | - | floating-point value representing a hyperbolic angle |

### Return value

If no errors occur, the hyperbolic tangent of arg (tanh(arg), or 

|  |
| --- |
| earg -e-arg |
| earg +e-arg |

) is returned.

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in `math_errhandling`.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If the argument is ±0, ±0 is returned.
- If the argument is ±∞, ±1 is returned.
- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

POSIX specifies that in case of underflow, arg is returned unmodified, and if that is not supported, an implementation-defined value no greater than DBL_MIN, FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN is returned.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    printf("tanh(1) = %f\ntanh(-1) = %f\n", tanh(1), tanh(-1));
    printf("tanh(0.1)*sinh(0.2)-cosh(0.2) = %f\n", tanh(0.1) * sinh(0.2) - cosh(0.2));
    // special values
    printf("tanh(+0) = %f\ntanh(-0) = %f\n", tanh(0.0), tanh(-0.0));
}

```

Output:

```
tanh(1) = 0.761594
tanh(-1) = -0.761594
tanh(0.1)*sinh(0.2)-cosh(0.2) = -1.000000
tanh(+0) = 0.000000
tanh(-0) = -0.000000

```
