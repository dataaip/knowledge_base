1-3) Computes the complementary error function of arg, that is 1.0 - erf(arg), but without loss of precision for large arg.4) Type-generic macro: If arg has type long double, `erfcl` is called. Otherwise, if arg has integer type or the type double, `erfc` is called. Otherwise, `erfcf` is called.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arg | - | floating-point value |

### Return value

If no errors occur, value of the complementary error function of arg, that is \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi} }\int_{arg}^{\infty}{e^{-{t^2} }\mathsf{d}t}\)

|  |
| --- |
| 2 |
| √π |

∫∞  
arg**e**-t2d**t** or \({\small 1-\operatorname{erf}(arg)}\)1-erf(arg), is returned.

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in `math_errhandling`.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If the argument is +∞, +0 is returned.
- If the argument is -∞, 2 is returned.
- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

For the IEEE-compatible type `double`, underflow is guaranteed if arg > 26.55.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
 
double normalCDF(double x) // Phi(-∞, x) aka N(x)
{
    return erfc(-x / sqrt(2)) / 2;
}
 
int main(void)
{
    puts("normal cumulative distribution function:");
    for (double n = 0; n < 1; n += 0.1)
        printf("normalCDF(%.2f) %5.2f%%\n", n, 100 * normalCDF(n));
 
    printf("special values:\n"
           "erfc(-Inf) = %f\n"
           "erfc(Inf) = %f\n",
           erfc(-INFINITY),
           erfc(INFINITY));
}

```

Output:

```
normal cumulative distribution function:
