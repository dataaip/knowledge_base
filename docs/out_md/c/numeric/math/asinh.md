1-3) Computes the inverse hyperbolic sine of arg.4) Type-generic macro: If the argument has type long double, `asinhl` is called. Otherwise, if the argument has integer type or the type double, `asinh` is called. Otherwise, `asinhf` is called. If the argument is complex, then the macro invokes the corresponding complex function (casinhf, casinh, casinhl).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arg | - | floating-point value representing the area of a hyperbolic sector |

### Return value

If no errors occur, the inverse hyperbolic sine of arg (sinh-1  
(arg), or arsinh(arg)), is returned.

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in `math_errhandling`.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If the argument is ±0 or ±∞, it is returned unmodified.
- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

Although the C standard names this function "arc hyperbolic sine", the inverse functions of the hyperbolic functions are the area functions. Their argument is the area of a hyperbolic sector, not an arc. The correct name is "inverse hyperbolic sine" (used by POSIX) or "area hyperbolic sine".

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    printf("asinh(1) = %f\nasinh(-1) = %f\n", asinh(1), asinh(-1));
    // special values
    printf("asinh(+0) = %f\nasinh(-0) = %f\n", asinh(0.0), asinh(-0.0));
}

```

Output:

```
asinh(1) = 0.881374
asinh(-1) = -0.881374
asinh(+0) = 0.000000
asinh(-0) = -0.000000

```
