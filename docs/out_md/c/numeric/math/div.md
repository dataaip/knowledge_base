| imaxdiv_t imaxdiv( intmax_t x, intmax_t y ); | (4) | (since C99) |
|  |  |  |

Computes both the quotient and the remainder of the division of the numerator `x` by the denominator `y`.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Computes quotient and remainder simultaneously. The quotient is the algebraic quotient with any fractional part discarded (truncated towards zero). The remainder is such that quot \* y + rem == x. | (until C99) |
| Computes the quotient (the result of the expression x / y) and remainder (the result of the expression x % y) simultaneously. | (since C99) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x, y | - | integer values |

### Return value

If both the remainder and the quotient can be represented as objects of the corresponding type (int, long, long long, intmax_t, respectively), returns both as an object of type `div_t`, `ldiv_t`, `lldiv_t`, `imaxdiv_t` defined as follows:

## div_t

```
struct div_t { int quot; int rem; };

```

or

```
struct div_t { int rem; int quot; };

```

## ldiv_t

```
struct ldiv_t { long quot; long rem; };

```

or

```
struct ldiv_t { long rem; long quot; };

```

## lldiv_t

```
struct lldiv_t { long long quot; long long rem; };

```

or

```
struct lldiv_t { long long rem; long long quot; };

```

## imaxdiv_t

```
struct imaxdiv_t { intmax_t quot; intmax_t rem; };

```

or

```
struct imaxdiv_t { intmax_t rem; intmax_t quot; };

```

If either the remainder or the quotient cannot be represented, the behavior is undefined.

### Notes

Until C99, the rounding direction of the quotient and the sign of the remainder in the built-in division and remainder operators was implementation-defined if either of the operands was negative, but it was well-defined in `div` and `ldiv`.

On many platforms, a single CPU instruction obtains both the quotient and the remainder, and this function may leverage that, although compilers are generally able to merge nearby / and % where suitable.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <assert.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
 
void reverse(char* first, char* last)
