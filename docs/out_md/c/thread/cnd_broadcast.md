| Defined in header `<threads.h>` |  |  |
| int cnd_broadcast( cnd_t \*cond ); |  | (since C11) |
|  |  |  |

Unblocks all threads that are blocked on condition variable `cond` at the time of the call. If no threads are blocked on `cond`, the function does nothing and returns `thrd_success`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cond | - | pointer to a condition variable |

### Return value

thrd_success if successful, thrd_error otherwise.
