| Defined in header `<threads.h>` |  |  |
| int thrd_create( thrd_t \*thr, thrd_start_t func, void \*arg ); |  | (since C11) |
|  |  |  |

Creates a new thread executing the function `func`. The function is invoked as func(arg).

If successful, the object pointed to by `thr` is set to the identifier of the new thread.

The completion of this function **synchronizes-with** the beginning of the thread.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| thr | - | pointer to memory location to put the identifier of the new thread |
| func | - | function to execute |
| arg | - | argument to pass to the function |

### Return value

thrd_success if the creation of the new thread was successful. Otherwise returns thrd_nomem if there was insufficient amount of memory or thrd_error if another error occurred.

### Notes

The thread identifiers may be reused for new threads once the thread has finished and joined or detached.

The type thrd_start_t is a typedef of int(\*)(void\*), which differs from the POSIX equivalent void\*(\*)(void\*)

All thread-specific storage values (see tss_create) are initialized to NULL.

Return from the function `func` is equivalent to calling thrd_exit with the argument equal to the return value of `func`.
