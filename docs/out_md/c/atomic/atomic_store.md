| Defined in header `<stdatomic.h>` |  |  |
| void atomic_store( volatile A\* obj , C desired ); | (1) | (since C11) |
| void atomic_store_explicit( volatile A\* obj, C desired, memory_order order ); | (2) | (since C11) |
|  |  |  |

Atomically replaces the value of the atomic variable pointed to by `obj` with `desired`. The operation is atomic write operation.

The first version orders memory accesses according to memory_order_seq_cst, the second version orders memory accesses according to `order`. `order` must be one of memory_order_relaxed, memory_order_release or memory_order_seq_cst. Otherwise the behavior is undefined.

This is a generic function defined for all atomic object types `A`. The argument is pointer to a volatile atomic type to accept addresses of both non-volatile and volatile (e.g. memory-mapped I/O) atomic objects, and volatile semantic is preserved when applying this operation to volatile atomic objects. `C` is the non-atomic type corresponding to `A`.

It is unspecified whether the name of a generic function is a macro or an identifier declared with external linkage. If a macro definition is suppressed in order to access an actual function (e.g. parenthesized like (atomic_store)(...)), or a program defines an external identifier with the name of a generic function, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| obj | - | pointer to the atomic object to modify |
| order | - | the memory synchronization ordering for this operation |

### Return value

(none)
