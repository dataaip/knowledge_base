| Defined in header `<stdatomic.h>` |  |  |
| void atomic_thread_fence( memory_order order ); |  | (since C11) |
|  |  |  |

Establishes memory synchronization ordering of non-atomic and relaxed atomic accesses, as instructed by `order`, without an associated atomic operation. For example, all non-atomic and relaxed atomic stores that happen before a memory_order_release fence in thread A will be synchronized with non-atomic and relaxed atomic loads from the same locations made in thread B after an memory_order_acquire fence.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| order | - | the memory ordering executed by this fence |

### Return value

(none)
