|  |  |  |

The `jmp_buf` type is an array type suitable for storing information to restore a calling environment. The stored information is sufficient to restore execution at the correct block of the program and invocation of that block. The state of floating-point status flags, or open files, or any other data is not stored in an object of type `jmp_buf`.
